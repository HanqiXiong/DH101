Lets hope that voters aren't that incredibly stupid. If they are the USA is officially over.,2024-05-05 17:14:34
I have a hard time understanding how someone’s conscience could allow them to permit Trump to win this election.,2024-05-05 18:40:53
"The only people saying this are those with the privilege to throw away their vote and won’t be affected by the consequences. If they are, I’m sure mommy and daddy will be there to rescue them. I am voting for my daughter’s rights to be protected and to protect the most vulnerable in this country like my elderly parents and POC like me. Our choices will shape the Supreme Court and therefore generations to come.",2024-05-06 06:56:02
"You can be critical of the situation now and still vote for him.  In all honesty, there is no good decision here and he will get skewered either way.  Bottom line is if you are critical of Bidens handling, Trump will let Netanyahu do what ever he wants.",2024-05-05 19:20:09
People think they are punishing Biden by not voting for him.  It's called cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.✂️👃💡 SMH,2024-05-05 21:55:48
"Yeah, because Trump has such a great track record to care about people like us peasants. 🤬 Good Lawd, I am just shaking my head and want to scream. When is this frigging nightmare going to be over and done?",2024-05-05 17:54:11
"People need to stop thinking this is a regular run of the mill election and realize it isn’t about loving your candidate, it’s about saving this country and democracy as we will not have freedom for decades if Trump wins",2024-05-06 04:06:29

Not to mention how worse things will get for the far away place nobody cared about a year ago.,2024-05-05 18:36:36
"So much of what we face as a nation moving forward is simply hate based. Decades were spent putting that genie back into the bottle only to have Trump come along and make that hate okay again. America has been fleeced by this guy. Bamboozled and conned. And half of America is okay with it. Even if Trump loses the upcoming election, he's already primed his half to deny a loss by his party. So it isn't enough that he and he alone lose the election, but all those that are up for election in Congress, the Senate, state governors, legislators, even down to council persons, mayors and school boards need to be voted out of incumbencies and voted against in challenges and elections. Trump isn't doing this alone. He has a huge following in every channel of government and if all.we do is just the kingpin, there'll always be an underlying to pick up where he left off. We simply need to crush the right and crush the hate from the top, all the way to the bottom.",2024-05-05 18:57:52
"I’m worried by the amount of people who say they are “both the same.” Did we not all live through the same pandemic? Where Trump’s actions and rhetoric cost, by the most conservative estimates, an additional 100,000 people their lives? Do those people just not matter? And do the people of Palestine not actually matter? Because Trump will do even less than Biden on that front.

I get hating this 2 party system. But the way to dismantling it is through local elections first. Throwing away your vote during a presidential election makes no sense and is counter productive to any progress we’ve been able to make pulling the current Democratic Party further left. Lotta good it will do when the far right is running the country.",2024-05-05 20:00:18
How can we convince MAGAs that Trump isn’t who he says he is?,2024-05-05 21:18:26
I'd vote for my dog over Trump and my dog is an idiot. Blue all the way for me. -A man with a conscience.,2024-05-06 13:46:14
"The only thing scarier than Trump as president is all those Heritage Foundation goons in positions of power. They seriously want to destroy democracy in this country because they know they aren't the majority, and want to ensure their remaining in power regardless of the majority's will. They would be in position to do incalculable damage to the United States, and must be kept out of power at all costs. Everybody needs to put aside their butthurt about Biden's Middle East policy, inflation, age, etc., and remember that this could be the last free election this country ever has.",2024-05-06 16:54:19

"It is far too early to pay any attention to polls — and in any case, democrats have been significantly over performing polls in elections since 2020 anyway. 

Biden is doing an amazing job and will easily win reelection once voters start giving him credit for his impressive record. All the talk of Trump being reelected because Biden is blowing it is playing into Trump’s and Putin’s hands, and according to their plans. 

The media apparently learned nothing drom the disaster of their coverage in 2016 and refuse to give Biden positive press while covering every move Trump makes.",2024-05-05 18:58:09

"As a woman, if Trump takes office, I could see me getting forced to reverse my tubal ligation in order to keep squeezing out kids I don't want and can't take care of until menopause hits me like a ton of bricks. Then again, I can also see menopausal women being imprisoned because they can no longer bear children. I can see the right to vote also being taken from women. I see minorities' rights taken. I see people being imprisoned or even slaughtered for not being straight and cisgender.

We CANNOT allow Republican rule for a VERY long time.",2024-05-05 21:55:59

"You are absolutely correct. The atrocities being committed in that part of the world have literally ALWAYS been there. The injustices are too many to name for so many people in different parts of the world. But the protest at universities is being driven I think by outside actors. And children are VERY easy to manipulate. Using a war that has nothing to do with the United States in order to pull young voters away from Biden is exactly what the Republicans want. Too bad it won't work. Had they not overturned Roe and enforced stricter gun laws and cared just an inch about the environment they'd probably have won young voters over. But the whole we hate gay folks, and 10 yr old pregnant rape victims should be forced to have the rapist baby cuz it's God's will, doesn't bode well for republians in winning over youngsters.",2024-05-09 11:51:25

"All of these comments here I feel could be directed at Biden. How could he be so stupid to allow this conflict to go on? Doesn’t he know how this is hurting his chance at reelection? Isn’t he afraid of a 2nd Trump presidency? Why is Biden being so careless when he knows what’s at stake for women?

Why not turn the heat on Biden to do the right thing instead of blaming people who are upset over a genocide?

I’m tired at people getting pitted against each other based on what our leadership does.

Well arguably the defining trait of conservative is having a more limited sense of empathy. Not necessarily no empathy. But that their range of who they extend it to tends to be much more limited. The thing with empathy is it can go toxic. When certain groups isolate themselves their empathy for their particular subculture goes critical. It begins to exclude all outside their group and may even turn paranoid. And the behavior that accompanies this could be defined as being a bunch of assholes.,2024-04-07 23:38:26

The alt-right is a minority group in the US and as such needs to garner a goodly number of independent voters in order to swing the election their way.  Fortunately for the rest of us, independent voters have been turning away from the ravings of Trump.  I'm not saying they are enthusiastic about supporting Biden either, but they aren't showing the same support for Trump.

If we remind voters that a vote for Biden not only is a vote for him, but for his staff and his policies it could blunt the ageism blade that the right has been wielding with abandon; never mind that on Election Day Biden will be 81 and Trump will be 78, just a 3 year difference.

We also still have plenty of folks here who aren't happy with the reversal of Roe v Wade and the Conservatives are continuing to push unpopular policies like declaring that IVF embryos are humans and that their destruction could result in prosecution.

People think, oh it's a church it must be holy. Dude, criminals will use every trick they can!

Like one church I visited built a church in some country where it was illegal to do that. So the locals burned the church down and took some missionaries hostage and they raised money to get the hostages back, thank God I guess, but then they will wanted to double-down and rebuild the church. SMH

Coincidently, since Reagan's trickle down economics failure of the 1980's, Democratic administrations have had to bail out every Republican administrations economic failures. 

The broken economy President Bush Sr left Clinton, the Great Recession -due to the housing crash of 2008 left to Obama, and the worldwide pandemic economy that Trump left Biden. 

Is it a coincidence that the party that likes to govern has had multiple returns of success during its tenure versus the party that gas lights its constituents, obstructs to the country's peril, and attempts to tear down the government from within. 

The Republican party has had nothing positive to show for its Presidential tenures except tax cuts for the rich -that we are STILL paying for, and endless wars. 

Given the Democratic party's economic track record the past 30 years, I trust that Biden will have us running on all cylinders again by time he wraps up his second term in office.

"The problem is that society moves forward. If you look back over time you see that eventually progress always wins. It has to do with how younger generations learn the good from the older gens and come to recognize the bad and tend to reject it. Thus over time society shifts and changes. 

Meanwhile there are people that hold to older ideas either out of dogmatic reasons or an inability to adapt. Add in the older generations that can't pick up on the errors of their ways. And over time these people tend to build up on the backside of society moving forward. And they begin to feel oppressed (ironically because they can't oppress people any longer). And they feel as though they are losing control of society (because they are). And whether it is their dogma or their cultural ignorance they fear that the change is destroying everything. 

So they get angry. Pissed off. They start rejecting the institutions that support the advances such as science and medicine. They become increasingly isolated from reality building bubbles of their own beliefs. And become increasingly mad at the world. 

So when a grifter comes along, particularly a narcissistic one that is desperate for adoration, they are going to say whatever the crowd wants to hear. Most politicians practice nuance. They are desperate not to piss off anyone that might vote for them. So they couch their comments in safe speeches. They practice saying a lot of words that mean nothing in reality. Or they talk about complex ideas that require a deep understanding of issues. 

All the MAGA base knows is that they are pissed. Hearing nuance of any sort pisses them off more. They feel like the world is being yanked out from under them by nuance. So when a thug like trump speaks to them he comes off as glib and charismatic. And he quickly learns what words get him the adoration he craves.

It doesn't stop anyone from voting, so there's a lie. And if ANYONE should be banned from running it should be insurrectionists. Apparently America will let any dumb corrupt mother fucker be in charge of a system they tried to destroy, which is fucking stupid of the highest order. 

Secondly. It wasn't ""democrats"" doing the banning. It was Republicans who asked the secs of state to do it because they were equally horrified as anyone else over the attempt to destroy America.

You honestly disgust me. You act like attempting to overthrow America is no big deal. Trump had multiple different ways to attempt to stay in power after we voted him out.

One side wants to ban (and quietly murder) gay and trans people, thinks black ppl should get shot by cops, thinks brown people don't deserve a chance at a better life here (but of course they don't complain about *white* ppl coming here - like russians having babies in FL so their kids are citizens and so they force themselves here).

""There are 4 central efforts outlined in the indictment regarding Trump and his allies’ efforts to overturn the will of the voters and undermine the results of the 2020 Georgia presidential election.

These include:

Efforts to get Georgia officials to invalidate or nullify the will of Georgia voters, including by “finding” votes that did not exist

The scheme to get 16 fake electors in Georgia to cast fraudulent electoral college votes for Trump, even though Trump did not win the popular vote in the state

Intimidating, harassing, and threatening Georgia elections workers based on false accusations and in an effort to influence their testimony as witnesses

Tampering with county voting machines

All 19 defendants, including Trump, are charged with criminal racketeering under Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which ties together individual criminal acts into a broader criminal network and conspiracy.

The Fulton County, Georgia indictment was brought by a grand jury of everyday citizens convened by DA Fani Willis. DA Willis is a highly respected veteran prosecutor who has been investigating Trump and his allies efforts to meddle with the 2020 election for more than two-and-a-half years. 

The grand jury heard from many witnesses, including state officials who were asked by Trump and his allies to help overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

"I completly understand and agree with the sentiment of the post, but I don’t like the wording of “treason” as a reason not to vote for him. Of course, it would be treason since he tried to overthrow the government, but going against your country isn’t always bad. If you go against your country trying to commit an unjust war or take rights away from marginalized groups, that is a good thing. Of course, in Trump’s case, his treason also happens to be bad, but I dont think calling it “treason” really does it justice. Overthrowing democracy (or rather the attempt to do so) is a better way to say it, as that’s an actual reason he’s bad. Treason just sounds like pounding down on seditious people who went against the government for good causes, whereas for Trump it was the farthest from a good cause.

All eight of them would have cheerfully eaten pepperoni but six of them decided dog shit was worth it to teach the pepperoni lovers that they can’t just get what they want.

"Visionary.  California has a wealth of talented Democratic politicians (e.g., Schiff, Porter, Newsom, Swallwell) at the moment, all of them over delivering across the board.  I am deeply grateful for their competent leadership as a counterpoint to the failure that is the current Republican Party.

> California Senate candidate and Congressmember Adam Schiff is calling for a major overhaul of American institutions, including getting rid of the Electoral College, expanding the Supreme Court and eliminating the filibuster.

> The sweeping policy rollout, obtained exclusively by POLITICO, reinforces Schiff’s central pitch in his Senate campaign as a defender of democracy, drawing on his high-profile roles in the first impeachment of then-President Donald Trump and the congressional investigation of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

> Though many of the individual agenda items are not new proposals for Schiff, together they present the fullest accounting of his vision to bolster America’s democracy in the wake of the norms-shattering influence of Trump. The package also lays down a marker for the Los Angeles-area representative’s driving message as the race to replace the late Sen.

"The Electoral College should stay in place. I wrote this several years ago to explain to Red Hats that the EC does not weight votes to dirt.

>Read Federalist No. 68[1] which has to do with the Electoral College, and it's intent.. It mentions nothing about weighting votes for dirt. Everyone should read it if they want to discuss the EC, and then the intent of the EC was quite clear.


>To understand the issue with the EC, and it’s outcomes recently, you need to know a little history. One, the Electoral College is tied to House Seats[2]. The House was supposed to expand with the population, but that got knee capped with The Reapportionment Act of 1929 [3]. This limited the expansion of the House to it's current 435 seats. The overall effect of this, is it gives dirt voting rights out of thin air. Where as a person in Wyoming(the least populous state in the Union) has almost 3 times the voting power of someone from California[4]..


>Now, with that out of the way, logic should be easy here. If the founders intended to give votes to dirt they would have tied the Electoral College to the Senate ONLY, as the Senate was the power balance to the ""People's House"". They wouldn't have tied it to seats that were supposed to expand with the population. Cause, as the house was supposed to expand with the population, the most populous states would have the the advantage in the house, and therefore most of the Electoral College votes as designed.


>Personally, the EC is corrupt, and it was corrupted a long time ago. I am ok with it if the House functioned as it should, expanding with the population. I would be in support of the EC if we repeal The Reapportionment Act of 1929, and institute the Wyoming Rule[5].

"Hard disagree. Every single citizen's vote should count equally. The president doesn't even really have power over a lot of things that are state related. I think many of the things he deals with, like national defense and treaties, are national and not state related.

"Yup. If you amend the constitution they have to follow the new wording regardless of any argument about ""original intent"". You just have to make the wording tight enough that they can't find a loophole to throw an exception through.  
But that requires a House and Senate vote to pass as well, so you have pretty much the same problem as SCOTUS.

SCOTUS is obligated to hold laws up against the constitution and see if they are constitutional or not. The reason they hold so much power right now is the constitution leaves a lot up to interpretation. You can argue our forefathers did that on purpose to allow society to adjust to the times.  But if you put specific wording in there it needs to be followed.",2024-01-12 07:57:22

"The Popular Vote Interstate Compact is very feasible.  It does not require a majority of states to participate, rather it requires that the states in the compact have 270 electoral votes (50% plus one).

Currently, there are 205 electoral votes enacted with 90 electoral votes pending, sufficient to put the compact over the line.  The 90 pending electoral votes represent states that currently have the law on the docket for discussion or vote this year.

I have no doubt in my mind that this will eventually pass.  Thereafter, the constitutionality of the compact will be tested in court.

Instead, we continue growing into this unwieldy one-size-fits-all gorilla that rules and controls any and all issues, and the President is expected to know everything, do everything, responsible for everything, and to blame for everything, even those things that are outside the constitutional powers of the office.

They were already conservative which wasn’t radicalized the way it is now.   They were told they finally got their conservative news outlet because of how all the others were always railing against what they believed.  

Fox masterfully made it all make sense to them.  In the beginning it was just providing a conservative viewpoint and that eventually morphed into everything being a liberal’s fault.  My in-laws won’t say those words, but everything they say adds up to it.  They mean no harm, they’ve just been duped and misled to believe things that aren’t true, and to also not engage with anyone who may contend that’s the case.  

My mother in law cares about abortion because she thinks it’s terrible that a woman can just walk into any abortion clinic up to 9 months pregnant and request an abortion for no reason.  That’s what she really believes because consecutive media has spun the words of the law to appear that way.  And why should she look any further?

I also blame CNN for making him president. To be fair to FOX (only once) they actually hated and ignored Trump in his run (for the millionth time) while CNN literally had large segments of him in real time and uncut running as if he paid them. 

Either CNN thought it was a cool sideshow for ratings, or they would boost a candidate because Hillary is unstoppable (omg) or Trump paid them secretly for airtime (too big of a conspiracy). 

Either way some people actually like what he said about China, immigration, job loss, corruption etc. I would say even that he was the only one to mention things that neither side would. But the problem was he had no plan, an insane plan (the wall and trade war with China), actually did the opposite (strengthened israels funding when he complained about endless wars and foreign countries taking our taxes) or whatever else Trump does in his insanity",2023-11-01 03:59:18

Why would a staunch anti-Muslim be against it? He even moved the US embassy to a controversial location in Jerusalem essentially validifying Israel's claim on it.  
Previously, the administrations had a neutral stance on it.  
He'd be giving up Ukraine. Maybe American bombers would even be bombing Gaza.

Eligibility under the 14th isn’t and shouldn’t be considered strongly when it comes to ballot access, just when it comes to actually taking office precisely because we don’t want that amendment to be weaponized by anyone. Frankly it was poorly written with too much room for individual interpretation.",2024-05-31 05:46:14

It's not just the prosecutions, he's going to start a fucking war and he'll bring down America because nobody is pushing back on the rhetoric.


 If they keep pretending it's just his bullshit in the end we are all going to lose democracy because even if he loses the election he's going to call for a war with General Flynn leading the way with his own militia that he's currently training including children.

The real reason he went after the office was that it was created by Obama and had received widespread accolades from the medical and scientific community. There is a video of Obama talking about the creation of the office (2015?) where he makes the comment ""it's not a question *IF* a pandemic will arrive, but *WHEN*"".

There is another clip of Obama discussing the Office where he says something like, ""It (pandemic) will likely come from China and will likely be a flu-like virus"". I've tried to find that clip but I can't locate it.

They are there to annoy and cause good people to quit so they can get more idiots like them in there to derail the whole thing. Mitch McConnell made it his life goal to get a conservative Supreme Court in place that can bring the whole thing down. They dont have good policy because they just want to ruin what is already there. They are going to eventually have enough power to fire every govt employee.

It does not need to look like the MAGA movement or what Project 2025 envisions. Coalitions come together and drift apart. 

It has to be frustrating to have one's own political party go down a road like the one the GOP has gone down. I wouldn't know what that was life, although it's not impossible that it could someday happen - a party that sees itself as a one interested in governance is not going to turn to a left-wing version of Trump, but there's no reason a left-wing opposition-minded part necessarily wouldn't do that.

"I went through this last year before roe was overturned (but I also live in CA so I don’t think it would have affected my ability to get a d&c). 

I had a twin pregnancy that was not viable and the natural miscarriage didn’t complete so I continued bleeding (a lot) and cramping for 3 weeks. When I went to the doctor they said it was urgent to do a d&c that day because I was at risk of hemorrhaging or sepsis, so they canceled other people’s appointments in order to fit my d&c into their schedule that afternoon. 

I would not wish this on any person. The fact that these women had to wait, travel, and may suffer infertility due to this FUCKED reality these “Christian” nut jobs are forcing us all into is beyond words. These people are fucking sick. The GOP is a fucking cancer.",2023-03-07 16:13:59

He played a role in creating a crazy crowd. A crazy crowd which drained America of its own spirit. Now people are leaving important, vital jobs because they can’t deal with the crazy crowd anymore. And now with these lawsuits, they have no choice but to let their golden child go. 

Now they’re leaving all of us to deal with the crazy crowd. Because the crazy crowd isn’t good enough to get help or be good people. And that’s assuming Tucker doesn’t come back, which he could.

In a first past the post winner take all system it cant happen. There can be a transition period where a new party forms and if they win the members of the old party will then migrate over to the new party as what happened with the republican party 150ish years ago. The best we can hope for is a new right leaning party forms that wants to govern and isnt filled with crazies but regular ppl who are sick of the republican bs and they gain more support than the republican party so they fight it out for a few election cycles where the republican party keeps losing and then the moderate conservative party wins out and becomes the second party that runs against the democrats. If we want a multi party system we need to change the system to be a parliamentary republic.,2023-01-07 07:10:06

The balance was to keep extremists from both parties from having too much power. But look what has happened. The extremists on the right have taken over the House. They do not care about governing, about making things better for We the People; they only care about power. In essence, they want straight white “Christian” men to rule and anyone else should be here only to *serve THEM*. That is true and it has always been true. That is why they are so cruel about not wanting to help the military after they have served, or the middle class and poor, the marginalized, the peons.

"They are stupid for sure, but I'd say it most directly exploits the inherently hierarchical nature of conservative politics.

It's also part of the reason we say ""Democratic voters fall in love and Republican voters fall in line"". And why they respond so positively to ""strongman"" rhetoric even when it's transparently phony. And why they love the police, who protect the interests of the ownership class. 

To the right-wing, might makes right and they swoon for self-serving corrupt kleptocrats with no apparent desire to serve the interests of their own voters, unless they happen to be corporate lobbyists with access to sketchy backdoors for unlimited campaign donations. In their hierarchical thinking, their leaders can do whatever they want to enrich themselves and to keep the peons in line and there is tacit agreement as long as those leaders hurt the most vulnerable (if you deserved better treatment you wouldn't be so weak) and hurt the people you hate first and foremost, never mind the fact that they told you who to hate and it's groups of people whose existence and activity have no effect on you.

Watching these people try to act tough while begging to serve every whim of the master without question will never not fill me with such contempt.

"**Short answer-**

No.  He can run as many times as he wants, but he can only win twice.  Technically, if he serves the two terms (Even non-consecutively), he can't run again after that, but that's only after a hypothetical second term, not after another loss.  He can run and lose forever until he gets that second term or dies- if he wants to keep running.  He could even legally run from prison if he winds up there.

The only President ever to be elected to two *non-consecutive* terms was Grover Cleveland.

**Long answer-**

The constitutional limit is that you can only serve two terms.  This was at first just a tradition begun by George Washington, the first President under the present 1789 constitution, who chose to only serve two terms, but then a constitutional amendment was passed legally after Franklin Roosevelt (FDR) was elected to, I think, four terms, in the Great Depression/World War 2 era.

FDR might have been re-elected to even more terms ***if*** he hadn't suffered a bad heart attack or something of that nature during his last term.  He was very popular- credited with both getting us out of the Great Depression and winning World War 2 (Though Truman mopped up in the Pacific after FDR died in office.  Truman is also the one who decided to drop the nukes on Japan.  I'm not saying FDR wouldn't have done it- we'll never know if he would have or wouldn't have.).  We also have FDR to thank for Social Security, though I think in fairness I should at least mention the huge black mark on his record- the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War 2 (Trivia: George Takei, the original Lt. Sulu on Star Trek, who is still alive, had his family interned when he was a child and still has memories of that time.).

To be clear, Roosevelt was well within his legal rights to serve all those terms, because the two term ""limit"" was only a very informal tradition back then, but it is the law now, and a modern President would not be.

The only ways around that are:

\- Pass a constitutional amendment changing the law, which would be virtually impossible in the current political climate because of the high threshold of support it'd need.   It's been a while since a constitutional amendment for anything was passed.

There's a long argument about whether or not the Equal Rights Amendment (for women) was enacted or not, but the short version is that the courts do not recognize it as having been enacted, so it is not functionally law, though some people think the courts are wrong.  It's not relevant to Trump anyhow.

\- Be Vice-President when a President passes away, after which \*I think\* in certain cases, if you're just briefly President under those circumstances, it may not count against the two term limit (But that would probably never apply to Trump- I can't see him running for Vice-President at this point \[Another improbable scenario- if no one gets 270 electoral votes in a Presidential election, I think the House picks the President and the Senate picks the VP, which could result in a Biden-Trump or a Trump-Biden administration (I'm not sure if it's the outgoing or incoming Congress that votes).  I don't think that's ever happened, though.  In order for it to happen, there would almost certainly have to be a third party candidate who wins some states and blocks the leading vote getter from hitting 270, and there's no one projected to be running who could do that right now.  Things can change, but... probably not.\].  And it'd have to be a situation where he hadn't already served a second term as President, like he becomes VP and then is elevated to the Presidency briefly at the end of his running mate's term, and then is allowed to run again.  If he's served two full terms as President, he's not even eligible to *run* for Vice-President.).

\- Turn America in an autocracy or authoritarian state and just ignore the constitution and the law and declare yourself dictator for life, hold an illegal plebiscite where people vote you into office for life, run for a third term even though it's clearly illegal and somehow get on the ballot and get the Senate to illegal receive the electors, or get the Supreme Court to rule against the clear meaning of a constitutional amendment that was solely enacted to prevent that.

Everything under option three would be the end of American democracy and the legitimate rule of law.

&#x200B;

But he can legally keep running until he gets that second term or dies- if he wants to.

President Biden has actually run for President 3 times- 1988, 2008, and 2020 (Though he only ran in the primaries the first two times, failing to get his party's nomination).  2024 will his 4th time running for President.

Jimmy Carter is on only other living one-term President other than Donald Trump and, I guess, Joe Biden, though Biden could still win in 2024 and be a two consecutive term President.  Technically, Carter could run again if he wanted to, but he recently turned 99 years old, was in hospice care a few months ago, hasn't shown an interest in running for anything in 40+ years, and voted for Joe Biden in 2020, so it would be beyond shocking if he actually did it.  He just legally would be allowed to.

I think there are some third-party candidates who kept running again and again in the past, losing every time, but I can't think of them off the top of my head.  Everyone that comes to mind only ran once or twice.  But I just have a vaguely recollection of seeing some people toss their hats in the ring constantly.  I know Ross Perot only ran twice (Random historical note: Donald Trump strongly considered running for Ross Perot's Reform Party's 2000 nomination to the point where he had political advisors mailing free copies of his book to Reform Party activists and was criticizing Pat Buchanan, the eventual Reform Party nominee that year.  Ironically, one of the big things he criticized Buchanan and his supporters for were what he claimed were ties to David Duke.  David Duke endorsed Trump when Trump ran as a Republican in 2016, and when asked by the press if he'd denounced Duke's endorsement, Trump claimed to not know who he was, an obvious lie.  For the sake of clarity, I should mention that Perot wasn't a far-right guy like the people who took over his party in 2000 when he decided not to run.).  I think Ralph Nader and Ron Paul only ran twice, but I could be wrong about either or both of them.

In any event, yes, Trump can keep running until he wins (After which he'd be constitutionally barred from running again), passes away, or gets sick of running.

Realistically, I would think after a second loss, assuming he didn't stage a successful coup afterward, his support would probably drop in every subsequent election he'd lose.  His whole brand is projecting the false impression that he's a winner when it comes to everything he tries.  The more he loses, the more hits that image will take among his supporters and potential supporters.

**Disclaimer:** I did 99% of this from memory.  It's just too much information for me to go look it all up and double check that it's all correct.  So, if you need it for something important- please double check.  But it's accurate *to the best of the my knowledge* as someone who started following politics at age 6 and took a lot of history courses.",2023-09-29 16:35:24
