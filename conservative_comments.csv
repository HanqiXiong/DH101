According to few Chinese I know that massacre wasn't the only one. It was the biggest one out of about a dozen at that time. There were other protests in years leading to it as well. Those were mostly by farmers fed up with government taking their produce. Parts of China experienced famine in late 70s and early 80s.,2023-06-12 06:57:31

"Hey u/Jibrish and r/Conservative you guys need to get in the habit of double checking your sources because the situation has gotten worse than you think. Tencent upped their stake in Reddit to $300 million in 2019.

source: [https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/reddit-300-million/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/reddit-300-million/)

r/ Sino has genocide denial in their FAQ and ban message, ask yourselves why they haven't been banned with a subscriber count of 90k. Another extremely suspicious subreddit which Reddit allows is r/ NewsWithJingJing. Reddit admins allow this to continue because they've been paid off to deliberately help push the spread of Russian and CCP fascist disinformation for years now.

Tencent just offered them the lowest interest rates. Go figure... China

Reddit then paid that money back with the agreed upon interest over the scheduled time. That gave them **investment validity** which is necessary before opening an IPO. But a Class B loan does not give the party supplying the loan executive powers or board control of any kind.

It all reads as if he had some sort of awakening, and quit.

Edit: To go further, everyone here seems to agree that this is a bad business decision for fox, no matter how it happened. Ratings and views spiked whenever Tucker was on, as he is literally the most popular MSM personality. In a situation where Fox just lost a large chunk of change from their liquid assets, why would it make sense to fire the one guy that keeps people coming back, generating revenue? 

We all agree that if Fox fired him, it was a bad business decision. So we are just all smarter than the people that run Fox? Sorry, there has to be something else going on here.",2023-04-24 15:58:54

There's no way this decision doesn't go all the way up the food chain.

If it was nothing personal, and they just wanted to go in a different direction with the network, they would have had the dignity to give him and his staff notice the show was ending. This has personal vendetta written all over it.

And for those thinking this is related to Dominion, I'm sure Fox would like it to look that way, but it's just convenient timing. Careful analysis of the facts makes it evident that just firing Tucker over the Dominion thing is illogical.

Also, the fact that Don Lemon was fired from CNN almost at the exact same moment as Tucker Carlson, is too much of a coincidence.

"Tucker was always explicitly news opinion which is not news. It's opinions about the news, i.e., entertainment. There are many such shows.

The problem of all news as entertainment is somewhat more recent. There is actually a lot of straight news during the day on Fox/CNN/MSNBC (as opposed to prime time news opinion shows). However, even on regular network news programs they have filled an increasing amount of that time with guests to offer opinions/talking points about the news.",2023-04-24 10:45:30

They back up the fact that Fox was knowingly lying by providing the texts as evidence.

In a message from November 4, Carlson texted a colleague that there was “no doubt there was fraud” in the election. “But at this point, Trump and Lin and Powell have so discredited their own case, and the rest of us to some extent, that it’s infuriating. Absolutely enrages me.”

In a text on November 9, Carlson referenced Powell’s Dominion claims, commenting, “The software shit is absurd.” (Carlson then said on television that night, “We don’t know anything about the software that many say was rigged. We don’t know. We ought to find out.”)",2023-04-24 09:19:19

"I'd agree on no outright ban.  People have existing family portfolios and ones for their kids educations, etc.  I think an outright ban will make people use blind trusts for their duration in Congress.  Basically, they can then claim I don't know of any activity and I have no say in any trading going on in the trust, so I'm in compliance.

But the financial industry solved the surveillance part of this decades ago.  Doesn't mean that there aren't morons who try get around it and do insider trading.  

Every financial company has a Compliance Department.  When you work for a financial company, you have to (a) give their Compliance Dept access to your brokerage type portfolios for them to monitor your activity (mutual fund type accounts are usually exempt), (b) set up an electronic feed from any brokerage firm to the Compliance Dept so they can do this all electronically, and (c) get pre-clearance for any trades you want to do from the Compliance Dept. 

A pre-cleared trade means you go to the Compliance Dept with a trade you want to do, before you execute it.  They review the trade you want to do and determine there are no conflicts.  If there are, like in this case, possibly pending legislation that affects some industry or etc, the Compliance Dept can choose to not approve the trade. 

But if approved, you can execute that trade and only that trade for the day.  Pre-cleared trades are only good for the day.  But if you don't follow this process, they can force a sale and force you to disgorge any profits. 

And this is all done via software.

The House Rs could stand their ground, allow a shutdown to happen, and use that position of power - something has to pass the House - to leverage concessions from the Senate and the White House. However, they appear not to have the fortitude or willpower to do it. 

I will note, Chip is very much a capital-C Conservative. I don't always agree with him, but the man is principled, intelligent, and strategic.

"In percentage, but not necessarily in dollars or economic power. Benefited is the key word here.

You could make a case that the benefits of 3% rate reduction would be more or less than a 2% one for the upper class given these rates impact different amounts of money. 

There's also the ambiguity of where we're drawing the lines for lower, middle, and upper.

Just for example with simple numbers, if I'm paying 10% less starting with 100k, that's +10k. If I'm paying 10% less on only 10k, that's only 1k. 

So, at least insofar as we view money as a relative power in an economy, the same rate reduction can potentially benefit the person starting with more money substantially more. A 100k+10k guy can buy more than a 10k+1k guy, both initially and as a result of what they gain from the same rate reductions, in other words.

You could knock the rate down to 5% for the 100k guy and still have that be the case, since +5k > +1k.

It's also  pretty strange to blame Trump for lockdown durations when the president doesn't control state lockdowns - states do.

The floridian economy is growing well but it is not the fastest growing state economy - Idaho is.

E-verify isn't mandatory for all, it's 25 employees or more. Most companies of that size typically already are the ones that comply. Illegal employment tends to happen at the small business level and contract level - not medium to large companies. It's actually not even always illegal for the contract sphere but that's another topic. So this is a win, but it's a small win for a guy with a practically undisputed super majority in his state.

For the surplus - most states have a surplus at the moment. This is due to a higher than expected nationwide tax revenue gain. You can read about it here; https://budgetblog.nasbo.org/blogs/brian-sigritz/2023/08/01/most-states-end-fiscal-2023-with-a-budget-surplus

"As infuriating as these b*******, complete b*******, indictments are, and with no disrespect to the people who are Trump supporters, he can't beat biden.

The last election was decided by less than 50,000 votes across several States. The reality of the matter is that the centrist, undecided, swing voters who are independent will *not*vote for Trump.

The fact that the left desperately, desperately, desperately wants Trump to be the nominee is all you need to know. They know they can beat him.

All of you hardcore Trump supporters have a decision right now: you can keep supporting Trump and watch our country get destroyed by Joe biden, or, you can be an actual patriot, an actual citizen, an actual decent human, and vote for someone who can beat biden.

"Wow this is absolutely __fucking__ psychotic.

Trump supporters are about as textbook fascist as it gets. Literally. Read Ur-Fascsim and they fulfill almost all 14 points. 

Trump is xenophobic and isolationist, a racist, anti feminist, pro chauvinistic machismo, and crony capitalist. MAGA is a literal cult of tradition and a rejection of modernity and an appeal to a mythological past that disenfranchised women, minorities, LGBTQ people. Disagreement is treason(RINOs), and he’s obsessed with plots against himself and against “American tradition”. They fetishizes the military and police, and are okay with state sponsored violent coercion of minorities and opposition.

But I'm supposed to believe there is nothing Nazistic or fascistic about them...

I’m not enamored with the democrats, but holy crap… Lindsay Graham was correct for once and everyone ignored him.

I think Haley would be an interesting candidate, her backstory sets up perfectly to counter democratic attacks… if people go after her abandoning her heritage or whatever, very easy to launch into “why doesn’t she get to pick who she wants to be?”. Which would be fair feedback! 

Desantis is a freaking mess and went to war with Disney for reasons? He might lose Florida if hurricanes season is bad.

"Thought I’d share terminology as it relates to civil cases (being found **liable**) vs criminal cases (being found **guilty**). Hopefully this helps clarify what the case decision means:

In a civil case, the standard of proof is “by a preponderance of the evidence.” This means that it is *more likely than unlikely* that the defendant is responsible for the harm to the plaintiff. So, the plaintiff must only prove their case by more than 50% of the evidence. If so, the jury must return with a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.

In a criminal case, the standard of proof is “beyond a reasonable doubt.” This means that the prosecutor must prove *every single element of the crime* alleged beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecutor is unable to do this, then the jury must return with a “not guilty” verdict for the defendant. 

**TLDR:** No idea where this will all lead. Just sharing some information about why the term **liable** is in every headline, as apposed to **guilty**. From a high level overview (specifics aside) being found liable in civil cases has a lower standard than being found guilty in criminal cases.

**Edit:** Punctuation / For those that haven't read the specifics about this **civil trial**: The jury decided that Trump was not liable for rape, but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation.",2023-05-09 12:38:02

Trump says that didn't happen.

As the term is used legally, witness testimony is a form of evidence (aside, this is why many news articles that say Trump claims things ""without evidence"" are incorrect). A he said/she said should not be enough for a criminal conviction, but in civil court all you need is for one side to be a little more credible than the other.

Apparently, the jury found the eyewitness testimony including corroboration from her friends of an outcry at the time more credible than Trump's denials. It probably didn't help that even his supporters would admit the guy is a serial liar. Also, the fact that he didn't testify. Or that his ""she's not my type"" defense lost a lot of credibility when he mistook her for his wife in an old photo.

None of us have any idea whether this happened, and the fact that she doesn't even know the year it happened should hurt her credibility. But Trump has done plenty of damage to his own credibility over the years.",2023-05-09 13:46:00

"I find the mob mentality in response to Trump way more frustrating and scary. It's nothing but fake outrage and people allowing themselves to be played by those in power. So they change the law in NY just to allow this, they make him fly to the state and waste all this time. Sit him down for hours and question him and try to catch him in something they can use to smear him on TV. That's just so vile. Yet look how many here play right into it. Of course if 40 years from now they get targeted these people would change their tune real quick. Some people are just wired to do the mob thing and others are not. So yeah I can blame Trump for not putting on a fake face like every other politician to shield him from these gotcha moments or I can praise him or being real and open when he speaks and blame the mob for not being able to handle it. This is why we get fake politicians who can't have an honest discussion. Because one wrong word and you aren't given the benefit of the doubt, that's it for you what you really meant doesn't matter only how it sounded or could be spun to make you look bad.

A great example is the mob reaction to Trump mistaking her for his ex wife. Nobody bothers to think that actually is great evidence to show Trump was being honest when he said he doesn't know her. Since he legit didn't recognize her in a very candid moment. Instead they just focus on the ""not my type"" contradiction which of course falls apart when you go into details (outside that photo she looked nothing like his wife and was actually pretty ugly).

"For a great breakdown of the entire indictment [Fox realeased an article on it here. They break it down piece by piece.](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-indicted-federal-counts-special-counsel-jack-smiths-investigation-classified-records) Please if you are a believer in truth and that no one is above the law in our great country at least read their article and decide for yourself.

This is an excerpt that I believe is one of the biggest deals in the indictment. Trump was having an interview with a writer, a publisher and two members of trumps staff about a memoir for Meadows, this interview was recorded with Trumps knowledge.  Trump was the only one who had any clearance.

(edit for context) Thank you to u/fretit who commented an article below that may give some extra context for the below conversation. In it, Milley had claimed that he was worried that Trump was going to go to war with Iran in order to increase his chances of reelection, among other very large claims that would be very detrimental to Trump. This article came out 6 days prior to the below interview.

Once everyone was introduced, Trump stated ""Look what I found, this was Mark Milley's plan of attack, read it and just show...it's interesting.""

During the interview.

Trump: Well, with (Says a Senior Military Official, but it is clearly Mark Milley) -uh, let me see that, I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack Iran. Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers, this just came up. Look. This was him. They presented me this-this is off the record, but-they presented me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. 

Writer: Wow

Trump: We looked at some. This was him. This wasn't done by me, this was him. All sorts of stuff-Pages long, look.

Trump Staffer: Mm.

Trump: Wait a minute, let's see here.

Staffer: (Laughs) Yeah

Trump: I just found this, isn't that amazing? This totally wins me case, you know.

Staffer: Mhm

Trump: Except it is like, **Highly confidential**.

Staffer: Yeah (Laughs)

Trump: Secret, this is secret information. Look, look at this. You attack, and--

(appears that some conversation is missing here)

Trump:This was done by the military and given to me. Uh, I think we can probably, right?

Staffer: I don't know, well we'll have to see. Yeah, We'll have to try to-

Trump: Declassify it.

Staffer: - Figure out a - yeah

Trump: See as president I could have declassified it.

Staffer Yeah. (laughs)

Trump: Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret.

Staffer: Yeah. (laughs) now we have a problem.

Just by having it in MarALargo means they were declassified. Trump has said publicly during his presidency that any work he takes over the weekend to Florida can be considered desecretized. Applies to this as well.

> B. Knew that he didn't de-classify them when he was still President.

He can say he mis-spoke and meant he didn't publish them as he was president and he's keeping them secret and not printing them even though he declassified them when he took them.

> C. Shared those classified documents to people without clearance or need to know.

That only applies to people other then the president.

"lmaoo this is the biggest piece of non evidence I’ve ever seen. So at one point in time he had classified documents and he said that he believed that he could not declassify them. This can easily be pushed aside as “I didn’t want the writer to inquire further so I told him it was classified and I couldn’t do anything about it.” 

Or how about the fact that it’s plainly obvious that he is not using the term classified in the technical sense. He clearly still thinks he has the rights to the documents. By “declassify” he is clearly referring to making the documents available for public viewing instead of making the documents available for him to view personally. 

The DOJ is getting him on the biggest technicalities possible using a dinosaur law that has never been enforced from Ye Old Book of Statutes. No other person would have ever gotten indicted for this type of shit. This is political persecution. We live in a banana republic.

So what you're saying is that Congress gets to supersede the Constitution without an amendment..?

>A federal appeals court in a 2020 Freedom of Information Act case, New York Times v. CIA, underscored that point: '“Declassification cannot occur unless designated officials follow specified procedures,”' the court said.

"One correction there is no formal process for the president. They can declassify anything at any time. The NARA failing to process the declassification does not magically make it classified.

The existance of a formal process would greatly damage the presidents ability to act abroad as classified information is integral to negotiations. And having to wait god knows how much time for the documents to be processed would cause a breakdown


Also the AEA is blatently unconstitutional, the supreme court has already ruled and determine that declassification authority stems soley from the executive office, and that no group jor board can restrict that. Congress cant just make a law restricting the presidents authority on declasification because they do not have any say in the matter, atleast not through that process. 

The only hope they have is the mishandlimg of sensitive information, which could still apply reguardless of classification. And if thats the case then its clearly political seeing as clinton did that, and had no authority to be in possesion of the classified information she had, and guess what, they laughed at the idea of prosecuting her for it.

I'm not a fan of Trump nor pretty much any politician at this point but showing classified documents to people could very well be within his means as POTUS because of the precedent Obama set with his Executive Order.  


The reality also is that if Donald Trump is considered an active target for this than Hillary Clinton should be immediately indicted for what she did FBI investigation or not as should Biden for what he did.  Obama's stuff was pretty much fine tooth combed over to show that he didn't have anything on him but Hillary should fucking roast for what she did if this is considered ""illegal"" to what Trump is doing now in the indictment eyes.

"Except………. That’s the whole point.  They were not classified.  He declassified them, as his right to do while in office.  Of course, he cannot do so while OUT of office

There IS a process for anyone BUT the President (yes, this includes Pence and at the time, Biden), but the President CAN declassify them , by simply wishing it to be so.   

Now, traditionally, Presidents tend to follow protocol, but we all know Trump and his ego .  That’s also NOT required to be done.  Again, he CAN declassify them


Showing them to people, even AFTER declassification?  That’s a ridiculously boneheaded move.  Of course, Trump…..

Getting into the weeds of ""Well she did, but they covered it up etc etc..."" is something I am not qualified to comment on.

And according to the constitution that's his right, all the secretization, de-secretization on the executive branch including military or the 4 letter agencies come from the president's power not the head archivist or the burocracy. The law governing this is meant to punish the archivist for mishandling Trump's papers not the other way around.

I have no idea. I was so pissed about that. Trump promised to investigate Hilary if he became president. That's probably one of the reasons Hilary went into hiding after the election. But his first day he broke that promised. I was really disappointed in him for not following through with that. Unfortunately it's republican's fault for democrats getting away with all their crimes. Republicans complain about democrats and say all the laws they break and horrible policies. But they never follow through and try to punish them. Democrats do good at that. They hate republicans so much they jump on a chance to get rid of one no matter if the allegations are true or not.,2023-06-10 00:34:08

"> the same thing that Biden and pence both did but taking longer to return the docs

It wasn't just ""taking longer.""  He allegedly lied about still having many documents.  He stalled returning them until the FBI raided his house.  Maybe these are all legitimate legal tactics; I don't know.  But the others immediately returned them without any questions or conditions.  It's not the same in that sense.  And the better example you could bring up might be Hillary Clinton, who actively destroyed a lot evidence, a very clear cut felony, but didn't get punished at all.

Trump is also on a recording, _allegedly_, in which he can be heard disclosing willingly classified information to non-cleared persons.  I don't think this is the case with the others.

To me, it looks like more and more he kept these specific documents as evidence supporting portions of a memoir in preparation.  It shows poor judgement that he chose to go head to head with the government on something like this.  It's an example of his hubris.

Finally, you can also make the argument that it seems like as long as you play the game of ""oops, I got caught with these documents, my bad, please take them back"", instead of insisting they are yours to keep, you might evade prosecution.  The government doesn't like to be challenged that way.

- Republicans cut off their nose to spite their face.

- Democrats rewarded McCarthy for reaching across the aisle by helping oust him, thereby assuring Republicans that there is no benefit to bipartisanship.

- Gaetz and the Republicans who voted with him have now helped the Democrats more than McCarthy ever did.

- McCarthy's desperate bid to win the speakership earlier this year was an exercise in vanity that was doomed from the start.

- Republicans can't convincingly attack Biden for incompetence when their own conference is demonstrating historic incompetence. Independent voters notice things like this, and it's not a good look.

- Another thing that would have been a bad look is letting the government shut down days after announcing an impeachment inquiry. Regardless of the inquiry's validity, that would have been sold as Republicans letting partisan BS get in the way of competent governance.

Seems like a significant portion of the Republican party's leadership answers that question, ""Never"" when it comes to border security and fiscal responsibility.

Yup.

People complaining about lack of unity are echoing (D)'s complaints about the right not simply agreeing with them 100% of the time.  ""So-and-so is so divisive!""  Bullshit, that's code for ""Do it my way or I talk bad about you!""

There's a vast uniparty.  Simply appeasing it for the sake of unity doesn't fix anything, it just means we stay the course under the Biden administration.

At some point you have to fight back, even if it ""looks like chaos"" which has even Fox now agreeing with CNN with the exact same talking points.

I know this sub is brigaded to all hell, but damn if people haven't lost their spidey sense for such things.  Even with the brigade things like this used to get pointed out on the regular.

I get it.  It's easy to hold up Gaetz and say ""He's colluding with Democrats"" over this, but damn if it doesn't sound like typical mud-slinging against the non-conformist.  He makes good arguments for his position.

I mean, they *did* vote the same, but I wager it's for entirely different purposes.  I don't put too much stock into people who want to act like Gaetz is a rino.  I've seen him on enough podcasts to not think he's necessarily too bad in that area.

Although, if one *wants* to put on a tinfoil hat.

The charges/allegations against Gaetz *did* recently just go away.

Could be.  I don't know.  He says the right things, imo.  It's not like a McCain(RIP) with severe TDS echoing all the D talking points.

Time will tell.  It's interesting, but I think some people are a little too hooked into the soap-opera effect and cheering and denouncing too loudly, or making predictions years or even decades out over this.

This was one of the main promises made, no omnibus and no continuing resolutions. He had 8 months to work up those bills, yet had none drawn up when time ran out. He then panicked and voted with Democrats to just kick the can down the road, again.

McCarthy was supposed to draw up individual budget bills for each department in government. The Freedom Caucus wanted this because, since 1996, Congress has pass massive omnibus bills that no one reads to keep funding the government. They keep funding the same plus inflation. This is a massive waste of tax dollars and isn’t budgeting at all, it’s avoiding responsibility and the work needed to get individual budget bills done.

McCarthy had 8 months to draw up those bills, work with his fellow Republicans and Democrats and get them passed. Instead, he did nothing and then panicked when the deadline to avoid a shutdown came. McCarthy then put up yet another continuing resolution to kick the can down the road another 45 days. 90 Republicans voted no, but the vast majority voted yes. Those numbers show you that the majority of Republicans in Congress are uniparty members, they’re in the club.

Although his abilities as Special Prosecutor are even more sad than light-weight Bob Mueller, his ability to boost the political prospects of the people he prosecutes is simply unparalleled.”

“He may be the best campaign strategist in the history of American politics, maybe ever,” Trump continued.  “We’re hoping we can get at least two more indictments in before the end of the year because if this keeps up I won’t even need to campaign.  Jack, you’re HIRED!”",2023-08-01 21:19:11

"The only indictment that seems semi-legitimate is classified documents case, and only if the claims that Trump purposely tried to hide the documents holds up.

But any legitimacy in that case is going to be overshadowed by the other two, which are clearly political hatchet jobs. The NYC case is clearly a farce.

As for this latest one, it seems very Constitutionally dubious. First of all, it’s questionable if an acting President can be indicted. That’s what the Impeachment process is for. Trump was impeached and acquitted over Jan. 6.

Second, the bigger issue is that even if Trump weren’t President at the time, the First Amendment should protect him. The First Amendment only has a very narrow carve out for “shouting fire in a crowded theater” which Trump’s speech and tweets on and leading up to Jan. 6 does not rise to.

The First Amendment has no test for whether someone genuinely believes what they say, so legally it matters not how genuinely Trump believed the election was stolen. Regardless of whether he believed it or not, the First Amendment gives him the right to say it as an opinion. Otherwise we could lock up every politician who says something they don’t genuinely believe.

Indicting Trump for saying the election was stolen is a dangerous precedent, because it will be used to silence future critics of contested elections.

The people who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6 are in the wrong, but Trump did not hold a gun to their heads making them do it. There’s no evidence he knew that would even happen. Whether he enjoyed the chaos that day is immaterial. You can blame Trump as a terrible leader with terrible judgment who doesn’t value this country’s democracy, but for this indictment to be worth anything, it needs to be shown that Trump conspired to have the Capitol broken into. Otherwise, everything he did that day is protected by the First Amendment.",2023-08-02 00:09:31

It is the same pattern on that level too.

It is now illegal to pay your lawyer his fees, for example(the 34 charges case, which, because of Trump's opinions, are all now ""fraud"").

I know that's not the recent one(It is from April), but it is the exact same spirit and it's easy to explain.

34 charges of felony.  What are the actual acts?  Basic accounting transactions.  Lawyer's bill filed for records, check written, stub saved. (something close to that anyways).  The 3 instances of normal accounting procedure, iterated 11 times, plus one more of one of them.

There is a small faction that would promote Trump because they Believe^^^TM he can't win.  That came out in the primaries when so called ""maga"" candidates were partly funded by (D) groups.

The rest legitimately fear Trump's possible win.  That's why these charges(and the failed impeachments) come forth, and have been year after year.

They want to try to make him look as bad as possible and possibly block his name from some ballots.  ""We have him this time!"" has been the theme for years.

In other words:  If they believe Trump couldn't win....they wouldn't be trying this desperately to nail him, they would be helping him, like others have done.

They want to stop the primary opposition, by any means necessary.

It is alarming how often DeSantis supporters(your flair) wind up saying the same things a lot of D subversives do, and pulling the same tactics.  ""Drumpf can't win, lol.""

"Did no one read the indictment? It literally said right at the beginning that Trump is not being indicted for questioning the results of the election.

Hillary's comments about Russia and the 2016 are beyond ridiculous. IMO, she should be held accountable for the way she pushed the Russia scam and implied it affected the election results when the evidence suggests it clearly did not. That said, she didn't attempt to physically overthrow the actual election results. She conceded the election overnight, and allowed Trump to take the oval office without any shenanigans.

If what the indictment alleges is true, what Trump did is unique. He went to great lengths to remain in power despite losing the election. That has never been tried before in US history.",2023-08-02 13:21:43
"The premise you're basing this on is that other presidents have committed similar crimes.

That's not a premise people who think Trump should be charged necessarily share.

There are additional considerations, such as availability of evidence. Trump was high profile and on camera and actively tweeting many things people found legally dubious, on top of surrounding himself with people who are attractive targets for flipping. Trump himself demonstrates some awareness of that issue, having suggested flipping should be illegal in the past.

Regardless of the question of persecution and criminality, I'm not sure there's any comparable president when it comes to providing prospective prosecutors material that would minimally suggest there's a lot to work with.",2023-08-02 11:34:21

The first part is already proven, so really it all depends on his state of mind when he was assembling these slates of electors. Was it a genuine attempt to overturn the election through fraud? Did he believe the election was rigged or not? It all depends what he was saying to his staff when this was ongoing.

"But I was surprised. Guess I am just not cynical enough, and thought these supposedly educated 12 jurors in Manhattan could look past their hatred of Trump and judge the facts presented.

Because the facts demand acquittal. The standard of guilty beyond reasonable doubt could not logically be met. This case was drowning in reasonable doubt.

If there was reasonable doubt that OJ Simpson didn’t murder his wife, then there is reasonable doubt that Trump was not guilty of the convoluted crime NYC prosecutors dreamed up.

For Trump to be guilty, all the following needed to be true:

A. Trump had to approve Cohen’s payments to Stormy Daniels. Only Cohen testified to this, and other witnesses said Cohen often acted on his own without approval. Cohen’s testimony was not very credible, since he lied on stand.

B. Trump had to know that he was paying Cohen specifically to reimburse him, when he signed that check. Trump didn’t even know Cohen was stealing from him.

C. Trump had to knowingly have committed fraud when the business records were labeled as legal expenses. According to NYC’s law, it is not enough for the records to be inaccurate. The  inaccuracy must be due to intentional fraud or no crime has been committed.

D. Assuming A-C are true, Trump would furthermore have needed to pay Stormy Daniels to help his election. If he did it to spare himself and him family embarrassment, that in itself is not a crime, and hence there is no felony. John Edwards easily got “Not Guilty” this way. But jurors just assumed (without evidence) that Trump wouldn’t care at all about Melania or his son Barron, both of whom would be plenty of motive to do the hush payments.

The reality is that there is reasonable doubt for A, B, C and D. But they couldn’t find reasonable doubt for just one of them. 

Is it hypothetically possible Trump is guilty of this never-before-charged crime? Sure. It’s possible A,B,C and D were all true but there just wasn’t enough evidence to know for sure.

But since when are we a country that assumes Guilty Until Proven Innocent???",2024-05-31 02:52:43

But there are roughly 6 states that will decide this election in the Electoral College, which are all polling within a margin of error. A small shift could tilt the scales.

It’s looking a lot like 2020 all over again. In 2020, Democrats were able to push the narrative that Trump was poorly handling COVID, which I personally think is the reason that Democrats were able to flip states that went for Trump in 2016.

Feinstein should have been forced out years ago. Fetterman is well under 72, but his doctor lied about his abilities. McCain and Kennedy both served while their brains were turning to Swiss cheese. Thurmond was two decades past his sell date.

"Nikki Haley has been my preferred 2024 candidate for some time, but if she keeps saying stuff like this, she’s going to lose me really fast. 

First, Congress can’t set statutory criteria for its own membership eligibility—that requires a constitutional amendment. I don’t want a presidential candidate who doesn’t understand how important the constitutional framework of our government is. 

Second, even if Congress set a criteria respecting members’ ages, a mental fitness test is about the dumbest way to do it because it will be instantly politicized. I bet we’d only make it about ten years in before the person administering the test was some former Planned Parenthood clinic director who now works as the coordinator of gender-affirming care for a children’s hospital. 

It would be a shitshow and it would only be used to weed out people that the majority political class don’t want. 

I’d be in favor of Nikki Haley saying, “I support a constitutional amendment to put a maximum age on federal officeholders.” But that’s not what she said.

Since I expect her to know better than this, I can only assume some campaign advisor told her this would ruffle Trump’s and Biden’s feathers. If so, she needs to hire better friggin advisors.",2023-02-16 12:57:12

"So your goal is to have the 1/2 of the average legislator die while serving? 

I just picked a number out the sky, but you could argue to could be even lower:
8.1% of people from 65 to 74 have advanced stage Alzheimer's.  23% of adults over 65 have moderate cognitive impairment.  34% of people spend at least 120 days infirmed in their last year. 3.2% of the population from 65-72 live in nursing homes, and 8.2% from 73-78 live in nursing homes.  

Now our representatives (117 Congress):
Senate average age: 64.3; 
House average age: 59.4

https://fiscalnote.com/blog/how-old-118th-congress

29% of Senate is over 70; 
19% of the House is over 70; 
16% of the U.S. population is over 70

97th Congress (1983) average ages:
Senate: 57.4 years; 
House: 52.1 years

So the rules have not changed (need to be 25 for house and 30 for Senate), yet the average age is up 7 years in both chambers in 40 years.  Meanwhile the median age has gone from 35 to 38 years old in the U.S.",2023-02-16 06:35:31

Just for the sake of argument, I urge the reader to recall that a certain unnamed political party variously employed poll tests to disenfranchise groups of people from being able to vote until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made such things illegal.

Now, again for the sake of argument, I urge the reader to consider a ""neutral"" third party asking one candidate during a televised debate (for the purpose of our example, a senator of three-and-a-half decades) to recite the first seven words of the Declaration of Independence and the other candidate (a career hotelier, perhaps) his commentary on a pending controversial case being considered by the supreme court.

If the reader is thinking of a comprehensive written test instead of a simple oral one, I would direct said reader to review and reflect on the past few supreme court appointments and how unbiased the Senate committees were for each candidate judge.

ADDENDUM - With a certain amount of hesitation, I would side with those recommending an age cap. The benefits of avoiding a president losing his facilities outweighs ruling out a wise, capable but older candidate.",2023-02-16 09:33:16

"Conservatives believe in free-market economics. This ban is not free market economics. The U.S. has more than once staged coups in Latin American countries that refused to sell land to US nationals and corporations, for the purpose of protecting and spreading free market, laissez-faire capitalism. We have fought wars to ensure anyone can buy or sell private land or property to whomever they chose. That’s what freedom is and this sub has long forgotten it. 

So yeah, it’s hypocritical for us to ban foreign corporations/businesses/institutions from purchasing land in the US, as that informs the world you have to uphold free market capitalism for us, but we don’t have to uphold it for you. It’s the opposite of be the change you wish to see in the world. If we want to ensure free markets globally, to prove they are a better system, we have to start at home. 

Everyone should have a right to sell their property, assets and land to whomever they want. This law takes away American economic freedom because artificially restricts the market. If I want to sell my property, be it stocks or deeds to land, to the highest bidder and that highest bidder happens to be a Chinese national, it’s my right to maximize my profit and sell to the highest bidder. If the Chinese business gets outbidded by a Costa Rican company, I’ll sell to the Costa Rican. You (and the state) should have no right to decide who I can’t sell to or restrict my economic freedoms.

If a Chinese corporation buys land in the US, they’re still subjected to corporate taxes in the US like any other native or foreign corporation. If they succeed and do well, good for them. If they fail and experience losses > profits, they’ll be forced to sell the land to some other business or corporation that can do a better job of churning a profit. That’s how it works. That’s how it has always worked. 

If you are a land owner and your expenditures and costs exceed revenues, you are losing money and will eventually be forced to sell if you don’t wish to experience further loss. Land doesn’t guarantee profit. It makes both profit (and loss) possible. 

Even if Gates or Blackrock buy the land, like any other company, they are either going to profit from this investment or concur financial losses, depending on their management decisions.  
—————
As per “they could literally starve us”. Corporations/Individuals who own farmland can sell and export their food products to whomever they want. If I owned a Wyoming farm and made a greater profit exporting 100% of my produce to Canada or Japan than selling domestically, of course I would act in my personal, rational self-interest and do so. In business our duties are to their shareholders, not the public. 

Likewise in Mexico they export much of produce to the US because it’s more profitable than selling internally. It’s not starving Mexico of produce. It’s business.",2023-02-12 07:03:07

""Arizona’s water is running worryingly low. Amid the worst drought in more than a millennium, which has left communities across the state with barren wells, the state is depleting what remains of its precious groundwater. Much of it goes to private companies nearly free, including Saudi Arabia’s largest dairy company.

Thanks to fresh scrutiny this year from state politicians, water activists and journalists, the Saudi agricultural giant Almarai has emerged as an unlikely antagonist in the water crisis. The company, through its subsidiary Fondomonte, has been buying and leasing land across western Arizona since 2014. This year The Arizona Republic published a report showing that the Arizona State Land Department has been leasing 3,500 acres of public land to Almarai for a suspiciously low price.""

"If you are a private military tech company that receives no U.S. federal or state funding, and was solely funded by the private investments and capital of its shareholders, then yes, you should be able to sell it to whomever you want. And from that sale, the U.S. government receives tax revenues from the profits you make. 

Be it Denmark, China, France, South Africa, or Israel, etc. To any state that is willing to pay the price you put forth on the market. 

Saudi Arabia likely had a hand in 9/11, the greatest loss of American civilian lives and attack on US soil, yet Raytheon and Lockheed Martin sells to them every year billions of dollars worth of hardware. 

However, nations that buy from you will often only purchase from you under contract terms that stipulate you can’t sell to other countries. Such exclusivity clauses under contract usually have periods (ie 10-40 years). I take it that’s what you mean by ‘produces top secret technology for the US’. 

So if you were paid for and contracted by the US to make exclusive technology, no, you legally can’t sell that technology to China (or any other party) until the contract you and US govt voluntarily signed states you can. Economic freedom doesn’t mean ignoring contract stipulations. 

But if that was not a part of your contract, then you should be free to sell to who you please, as Raytheon and Lockheed do.

Even Israel (via their corporations), US’ closest Ally, sells cutting edge military technology to Russia, our #2 geopolitical rival. It’s very likely such sales were made after the exclusivity clause of their contracts with the US military expired.",2023-02-12 10:14:16

> Personal life

Feinstein was married three times. She married Jack Berman (d. 2002), who was then working in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, in 1956. She and Berman divorced three years later. Their daughter, Katherine Feinstein Mariano (b. 1957), was the presiding judge of the San Francisco Superior Court for 12 years, through 2012.[231][232] In 1962, shortly after beginning her career in politics, Feinstein married her second husband, neurosurgeon Bertram Feinstein, who died of colon cancer in 1978. Feinstein was then married to investment banker Richard C. Blum from 1980 until his death from cancer in 2022.[233]

In 2003, Feinstein was ranked the fifth-wealthiest senator, with an estimated net worth of $26 million.[234] Her net worth increased to between $43 and $99 million by 2005.[235] Her 347-page financial-disclosure statement,[236] characterized by the San Francisco Chronicle as ""nearly the size of a phone book"", claimed to draw clear lines between her assets and her husband's, with many of her assets in blind trusts.[237]",2023-10-02 15:38:30

It's a complex question and I don't really have the answer.  In the days of the founding fathers, it simply wasn't possible for one person to control the flow of so much information.  Any information had to be printed and physically distributed, so there was a concrete, practical limit to how much influence you could have in the media.  I don't really know that there is a solution to that other than creating a friendlier environment for competing media and that would take a long time fix due to the inertia companies like Amazon have.

1.) Whether you like it or not, currently being a politician is a career. if you make it so it cant be a career it means the pipeline where future politicians come from will fundamentally change.

Since there is no longevity anyone who opposes them can be removed without issue, and anyone who is already against them will simply never be granted the spotlight unless its absolutely neccacary

I disagree but I see your argument.

Term limits would function like an audit system, like checking the crawlspace for rats once in a while. The political ""pipeline"" MUST go, the development of career politicians that ends in a presidential campaign is only an avenue for corruption, the ""club"" and legacy establishment beliefs to taint the leadership of this nation.

Trump made it without the club and it scared the crap out of the establishment, so much that it has resorted to embarrassing itself, right in front of our eyes in the interest of keeping Trump out of office and sharing the most disgusting bowels of the elite.",2023-10-02 10:47:45
"These are all really good points. I don't like that you are likely correct on most of this. But I'll admit it.

You've clearly thought through some of these pitfalls, so I'm interested in your opinion on something else if that's ok?

What would be your thought on capping the size of a state to say 10M (or another number, maybe 5M) people? Every census, if there's more than the cap, they split the state into 2 states of roughly equal populations. You tie that to a fixed ratio of representatives to population. Maybe 250k to 1.

This would prevent states with small populations from having too overbearing away over the national vote. It would make it harder for lobbyists because there's more and more people to fund, so they spend less per person, which would at least decrease some of the corruption. We could keep the electoral college since it would be within bounds of feeling right.

It doesn't solve the inside trading issue. But it could help in other ways.",2023-10-02 10:43:16

In my opinion senators being “unevenly distributed” is actually a good thing. Because if both houses of Congress were proportioned the same way there wouldn’t be much point in having two houses.

When the federal government was being formed the founders (wisely) thought it would be better for the government to do nothing than to do something unpopular.

As for the electoral college; I think it’s a good thing that it combines both proportioning methods into an entirely new method.

3.)I think more represntives actually makes it worse. It dilutes the power of each individual rep and puts more power in the hands of the ""senior reps""

I personally think the only way feasible short term solution would be a rule that once a senator/rep comes into office they and their spouses are forbidden from managing stocks, or have all their portfolios managed by a outside entity which is not allowed to disclose to them where there assets currently are until they leave office.

You don't tell hypochondriacs they really are surely going to die of some yet uncontracted disease any day now and they should never leave home. You don't tell someone with body integrity disorder to amputate their healthy limbs because they feel disassociated from them. That's absurdity. You counsel them to come to terms with reality and to love and accept themselves. That is compassion and responsible treatment. Anything else is spreading and encouraging hate.

"I don't care if people want to sterilize themselves, provided they understand that they are sterilizing themselves, and wave their right to sue because they sterilized themselves. They can always adopt kids or become foster parents, and we may see medical technology improve to a point that we don't need intensive surgeries to turn on/off fertility.

That being said, I don't think the psychology and medical community are barking up the right tree when it comes to defending puberty blockers, hormone treatments and top/bottom surgery for minors.

It's a viewpoint that would probably get me canceled, but I personally think it's arrogant to suggest that a teenager under puberty and social pressures is capable of making decades long decisions, at minimum without further evaluation. In fact I question their research specifically when it comes to Limbic system development, even though this makes me sound like some kook.

We push these teenagers into college with loans they can't pay for and then gasp when these kids can't pay them, and now you have more debt plus potential medical complications from even further early interventions about a kid's life decisions.

If they turn 18 as far as I'm concerned they can make whatever decisions about their mental or physical health that they want within legal limits, but I'm opposed to pretending teenagers have informed consent. They may be perfectly capable of undertaking greater decisions with time, and they should be given opportunities to mature, but we're not talking drivers ed.

I think it's also absurd to paint this viewpoint as ""Genocide"" or whatever. When someone says a hypothetical like ""Do x or I'll harm myself"", that's a sign that the person needs therapy and compassion, not a sign that you should let them do whatever they want, or in some cases that they may be toxic.

But people in Texas act like Dr. Pat and their life partner are packing up their home in Berkeley, stopping off in San Francisco to load up a bus full of homeless people, and taking them all to Texas to open a string of Atheist abortion clinics. That is simply not the case.

All of that said, the amount of children in the United States receiving any kind of surgery or even hormone blockers is very small (significantly smaller than the number of children who went to bed hungry tonight, which is an actual issue that we *should* be focusing on). Even in California, it’s very uncommon for children to undergo any sort surgery, but not impossible.

I’m fairly liberal and as far as I know, in my circles in Southern California, everyone agrees that only adults should be having surgery. I’d argue that therapy/counseling for “gender-affirming care” is okay, to help children coping with who they are, and I’d support the idea of letting children embrace who they are (without surgery) and that’s probably where i diverge from agreement with most people on this sub.",2023-09-02 01:17:56

When being poor is endemic, it creates fractures in society - these are fractures that people fall through a lot of times through no fault of their own. We are living it right now.

"The best way forward would be to reform SS instead of removing it. Make it so everyone who paid in receives their money back, but in a locked CD until age of 65. The CD can be placed against government bonds as interest, or you could place the CD into a privately owned bank. Rename the CD to reflect that it is meant for retirement. 

This way, if you work and pay into the system, it goes directly back to the worker. If you are unable to work, then there would be a safety net that's not removing money from 99% of workers. It would be taken from taxes we already collect for those who make over 500k a year. The funds would be placed in every unemployed Americans private CD and it would only be available for the government bond option. However, the moment they get a job, the funds stop being put into the CD and their own money it put in. The age they could pull out the CD would also be hard locked at 65. 

These reforms would ensure the future of SS for centuries. There would be no new taxes, workers would receive more return for their money, and the most vulnerable unemployed Americans would still be protected at their old ages. So the stay at home parent would still receive funds after their working partner dies. However, the moment any reforms are presented buzzwords are used to make people think they're removing the safety net.",2023-08-21 15:19:19

"> I'd argue he would never have received the employer portion in the first place

Maybe, but maybe not.

Let's say a company decides they are willing to spend $100k to fill a position. The way I see it, there's three things they can do.

First, they could advertise a $100,000 salary. Someone accepts the job, and the company starts paying him $100k per year. But along the way they remember they have to pay 6.2% of that to SS, 1.45% to Medicare and $420 for FUTA. Now because they didn't do the math beforehand, this $100k position is costing them $108,070 to fill.

Second, they could do the math beforehand and advertise a $92,503.48 salary and pay out $100k

Third, those taxes could not exist and they advertise a $100k salary and pay out $100k

The first scenario is the only one that would not result in more money in the employee's pocket if the tax were abolished, and it relies on the company's accountants to not do the math to find out how to actually make the expense of hiring someone be equal to or less than the desired cost to fill their position, which seems a bit off to me.",2023-08-21 16:21:50

">honestly I probably pay a lot more when considering SS, medical insurance, and all the other taxes and fees the govt bleeds from me everyday.

No, no you don't, and stop repeating this BS lie. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income

The US average household disposable income is nearly 2X even when taking into account Swedish ""social transfers"". 

If the US were to match Sweden in every aspect, the average US household would be 2x as poor. 

I lived in Europe for a few years too, and it's shocking how poor people there are compared to the US. Many families have only one (or sometimes no) private cars, whereas nearly every family in the US has a car. Single building family homes are extremely rare, unless you're in the countryside. Towns like Copenhagen have much smaller suburbs than a place like LA and the average house footprint is much smaller. 

Of course if the average American downsized to that level they'd pay far less. But saying they live a ""better life"" is plain wrong.",2023-08-21 22:08:30

Also, the ability to have banks hold onto more cash would substantially reduce the possibility of a default and a recession. The reason why banks today default and go bankrupt is because they do not have the cash on hand to produce customer requests for cash. If the government was providing a way for them to gain cash every pay period, banks would not default as much as they have in the past. 

All this does is move the profits into the hands of people within private banks, and provides more cash for banks to loan out and hold in reserve for a mini bank run. The only downside is the possibility of raising taxes on the 500k tax bracket to pay for an every growing population.

2.)Moderate Republicans in Swing or Biden districts  
Its important to remember that while you may support Jordan, Jordan is among the most Conservative republicans in the house(He founded freedom caucus.).

Nah the reason they are opposing Jordan is that since he came into the House he consistently attempted to organize primary opponents against republican incumbents who he didn’t deem “conservative” enough.

Trump was quite literally not on the ballot in 2020.

Edit: whoops, I misread and thought this said 2022. Yes, Trump lost those states in 2020 thanks to the changes in election laws that allowed for Democrat ballot harvesting and mail in ballots and all of that.

Trump won in 2016 because election laws hadn't been changed thanks to covid and thus ballot harvesting and mail in ballots and all of the other Democrat strategies weren't in existence yet.

>The Left voted in 2020, whether by mail or in person (which is a different problem), and that's why Biden won.

We've had thousands of years experience with alcohol, and that has lead to relatively healthy and adaptive taboos and expectations about booze.

The trick is that none of that could be a law, just like it's not illegal to have a beer with breakfast just frowned upon, but I think more people could be on board with legalization if there was an assurance of societally enforced expectations around responsible consumption.

"The elephant in the room is the ridiculous classification of Marijuana to be a schedule 1 drug (just like heroin.)  Why won't congress move their fat asses about this? Let me speculate:

1. Big Pharma doesn't want it because they'll loose revenue from people self-medicating instead of buying drugs from them, and everyone knows the corporations run the American Government, not the people. Big Pharma has both Democrats and Republicans by the checkbook.

2. Stigma from the religious right. Many Christians support legalization but the majority don't. This is a issue for the Republicans.

3. Lots of money wrapped up in the ""war on drugs"". There's a reason why it's a failed war. Nobody wants to win it because look at all the big budgets funding law enforcement in both federal and state levels, prisons, lawyers, etc... etc...  Issue for both sides of the isle.

4. The Democratic partly is effectively Marxist now, in philosophy and practice. Marxists love to keep as many under the thumb of potential law enforcement as possible. It's a control mechanism (ie: invite millions of illegal immigrants with no way to become legal permanent citizens)  Right now millions of users are ""legal"" according to state laws but still outlaws on a federal level. This has controls for gun ownership and federal employment (the largest employer in the USA.)  Marxists like to have people outside of the law.

Abortion potentially impacts just about everybody in some way. Far more people than the number who smoke dope. Imagine a female in an abusive relationship she’s trying to leave and then she gets pregnant. Now imagine she’s your daughter and is facing the prospect of being tied to her abuser for life. You think abortion in that scenario only impacts your daughter?  Even if that were true the consequences are life altering for her. That anybody would want the fucking government deciding what she can do with her her own body in that scenario is mind boggling to me.,2023-05-25 13:52:38

Look, this was a hyperbole to make my point – like I said, I recognize where the core of the disagreement is, and I know it's not ""whether women deserve rights"", but despite talking about sincerely-held beliefs yourself, you don't seem to be willing to recognize them in others.

> Biologically it's a human

I don't think the verbiage of 'human' vs 'person' is hairsplitting. Cancer cells are also biologically human, but they're assuredly not a person. In fact quite literally, a cancer cell is a cell that has forgotten it's supposed to be part of a multicellular organism, and instead begins growing and multiplying in its own interest, rather than the interest of the human it is a part of. It's not the hugest stretch to call a tumor a ""distinct human"". I use the word person because personhood is what entitles you to rights, not humanness, otherwise there's a lot of absurd examples one can come up with.

> It's a distinct human

You keep citing 'science' here, but in general science does not make moral judgements, that is for people to decide. Is an embryo a human? Absolutely. I think the word 'distinct' is doing a lot of work here though. It's certainly not a human that can survive on its own; it doesn't have a 'distinct' body, given that it is physically attached by biological tubing to the mother.",2023-05-25 16:14:07
"> the more accurate analogy would be if I donated 

Donating implies consent, and we're talking about the case of rape.  I'll accept that analogy if that kidney was taken from you against your consent.  So if someone needed your kidney to survive and your refused, would you be a murderer?  Does the recipient have the right to take it from you by force?

> Neither, individually, is a human.  Is the unborn a human?

What do you think they are?  Non-human?  Dead?  More important than what we label them is why does the moral consideration switch at fertilizatioin?  In other words, why do you care about post-fertilization sperm and eggs more than pre-fertilization sperm and eggs.

I don't disagree that an abortion is the murder of the human child.  I think the murderer is the rapist father that decided to put the child in a non-consenting mother.  It's unfortunate that the child is in a situation where it must be attached to it's mother to survive, but that's also the father's fault and the woman's rights matter.  To me, that outweighs the rights of the child that was going to die as spem and egg anyway.

I will say though that I respect the point of view that the child's right to live outweighs the mother's rights, and we're probably not going to change each others' minds here.  I do think you should at least acknowledge that the woman's rights are being violated in that process, though.  You left that out of your ""core of the argument"" discussion.",2023-05-25 16:19:25

"I considered this, since Trump does frequently use prediction as part of his narrative, but it still sounds like he thinks there's a real possibility since he's trying to discredit anything they have ahead of time -

> ILLEGAL LEAKS FROM A CORRUPT & HIGHLY POLITICAL MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE

This is distinct from claiming they have nothing, which he has done when he genuinely didn't think there was anything on him. He's also asking for action on the matter which will give us some read on what Trump support levels are -

> PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK

This is a risk, since if the protests are relatively mild, or don't occur, it's not good for him. If the protests are substantial it could serve to affect the calculus regards whether it's worth continuously pursue legal means of removing him from politics if it's going to cause severe backlash.

I think there's likely a death by a thousand cuts tactic at play here, where Trump is gradually reduced by outlasting the energy of his base, on the premise they can't keep continuously being outraged to point of politically mobilizing. Plus, the treatment of Jan 6 to dissuade his supporters from crossing certain lines to support him.

Trump has much less emphasis on gender related issues compared to DeSantis. Trump does not have a fleshed out theory of a woke agenda as a major threat to America, and has mostly focused on globalization and the elite that manage it. For Trump, that means to some extent the Republican party and its donors are complicit in the big threat. For DeSantis, not so much. Hence Trump is viewed as more anti-establishment, and DeSantis more pro-establishment.

DeSantis and Trump are fairly distant in position on Ukraine, with DeSantis supporting aid to Ukraine and Trump supporting appeasement via giving Russia land. DeSantis seems less isolationist in general.

DeSantis has more concern for environmental issues. Trump rolled back many environmental regulations, while DeSantis has actually protected a few of them.



The biggest issue with DeSantis in terms of logistics of actually winning, is that he lacks charisma and his public persona is almost the opposite of what drew people to Trump - he sounds more calculating and filtered which is not good for an anti-elite and anti-intellectual environment.",2023-03-18 10:31:25

"I suspect Democrat support has been steadily dropping across the board ever since 2016. They're not voting Republican, they're just staying home and leaning more independent. Though I suspect more Democrats than people expect have outright switched sides. 

The only they've been able to cover up that implosion of support has been with crooked polls and outright fraud. But there are limits to that. Consider Arizona where a Rasmussen poll targeted as a ""late exit poll"" produced dramatically different results than the 2022 elections there, despite only six months distance. 

If by 2024, the swamp hasn't imploded, they'll be desperately trying to cover up the fact that their base is exhausted, cynical, and certainly not ready to vote for Biden or whatever other stooge they can drum up. 

The globalists at this point pretty much can't win a straight election. That's true in the US, in Canada, and I suspect increasingly in Europe, as well as Australia and New Zealand. Ardern resigned, Macron is deeply unpopular, the Brits are pretty much turned off both Labour and Tories, and Trudeau is hanging on by a thread.

"DeSantis is at best, a discount Trump or an alternative Trump. The Dems will demonize him the same way they demonize every GOP candidate. ""Baggage"" is almost irrelevant at this point, and a classic RINO talking point, alongside ""muh mean tweets"" and ""unpresidential"". 

Furthermore, in case you haven't been paying attention, Republican vs Democrat is almost irrelevant at this point given how the swamp has been running rampant. Do you think if they were willing to cheat to beat Trump and lose less at the midterms, that they'd suddenly stop and let DeSantis win? If that did happen, it would only raise my suspicions about DeSantis. 

Similarly DeSantis choosing to run against Trump is such a politically ill-advised move that the only explanation for it that makes sense to me is he's compromised. He could just sit on his hands this cycle and scoop up the 2028 nomination, whereas running against Trump risks alienating the voters he'll need in the future.

>This is a loser strategy. Trump lost Wisconsin by 20K, you don’t think it’s important to try to swing those 20K? You don’t think that it was bad that 17K moderate votes in Arizona were turned off by Lake after she told McCain voters to not vote for her.

I do think it's important to convince people. I just don't think it's possible for any candidate from any side to win an election because they convinced the others. Liberals hate conservatives so much they won't switch, and vice versa. And I don't believe there's enough truly independent voters to matter. A lot of so called ""independents"" are people that say they don't like either party but will always vote for the same one. Both parties are so far apart now that for a person to switch from one to the other would have to be because their values actually totally shifted, not because the candidate convinced them they would better represent their values, if that makes sense.

>GOP house candidates outperformed Trump in 2020, he would be president if he won those margins. Mike Garcia won a 20 point swing from Biden’s 2020 margin, not because of getting a MAGA crowd in Los Angeles to turnout for him but by winning over independents and swing voters.

I'd say it's because Democrats focused a lot on ballot harvesting and mail in ballots on the presidential race in really contested swing states, not so much in local races in safer states.

>2020 and 2022 have shown that yes, Independent voters exists, swing voters exists. Appealing only to your base doesn’t get you elected. Candidate quality does matter. There is a reason why Oz performed much better than Mastriano in PA

Wait, I thought the narrative was that Oz was a terrible candidate and that's why he lost to a guy like Fetterman?

Either way, the fact that Fetterman got elected shows you that candidate quality does not matter all that much. When a guy that literally has brain damage can get elected, that means people will vote for the candidate with the right letter next to their name.",2023-03-18 11:44:20

Yeah, occasionally, the liberals run a hit piece. It's way smaller time though because again, DeSantis is not the biggest threat to them.


>That’s great and all but how you respond to these attacks is important. Tweeting out at 2am doesn’t help your case. And it’s not like this is all fake news, all of this could have been avoided if Trump was faithful to his pregnant wife.

Tweeting out connected him with his base. It's exactly what he should be doing.

I don't think you remember the first few years of the Trump administration well. The complaint was not that he was a good husband. The principal complaint was that he was a Russian asset that stole the 2016 election. All of that was completely false, but that's all you saw when you looked at opposition to Trump.

>That’s not true, while not the “electorate”, a lot people, mostly women, had problems with Trump starting an affair Marla Maples while stilled married to Ivana. It was big news back in the 90s, I’m guessing you’ve only been following trump for a few years now (even doubt you were on the 2016 train)

The data doesn't show that.

The data showed that one of the principal reasons Trump lost 2020 was the youth vote, people who dont know or care about any of that. All those people who were around for the 90s drama tended to vote for him.",2023-03-18 11:34:37
">There's a reason they don't publish hit pieces on him as much as trump.

This is because he is not a national figure, yet. He's a Florida figure, and the DNC has cut their losses in Florida.

Trump didn't get the hit pieces until he won the nomination.

There is absolutely no comparison to the level of media hate directed at each candidate. 

I love my governor. He's fantastic across the board and will be a great president, but he has not been targeted anywhere close to how Trump has been.

DeSantis wins the popular vote, but Trump gets the nomination. Trump only got 44.9% of the vote in the 2016 primary, which is exactly in the range is he now.

"1. Regardless of whether Trump wins or loses in 2024, DeSantis is already well positioned to be the presumptive 2028 nominee. The fastest way for him to screw that up is to align himself against the Trump supporters who got him elected in the first place. 

2. DeSantis doesn't need to run against Trump to line himself up for the VP slot. In fact, if that was his goal, he'd be much further ahead to endorse Trump. 

3. Who benefits from DeSantis and Trump going 12 rounds? Nobody but the opponents of Trump. 

4. What is the game plan of Team DeSantis to beat Trump? ""Vote for me, I'm Trump but not Trump?"" or ""Vote for me, I'm Trump but ""electable""? Neither of those are going to resonate well with the GOP base or beat what Trump is selling to them. 

5. The swamp has already demonstrated a willingness to use captured GOP figures as catspaws against Trump. There's the NeverTrump movement, Romney and McCain, the Lincoln Project etc. If DeSantis runs against Trump, he'll be aligning himself with those types. Good luck winning the primary and then the general with that association driving down GOP support.

Encouraged all to get vaccinated, but banned vaccine mandates.  We don't have another pandemic yet, but I like that he made decisions by considering the costs of mitigating Covid rather than just obsessing about whether he was going to be blamed for every covid death like other spineless politicians. 
2. Banned CRT and other woke ideology from being taught in public schools. Parents should not have to allow their children to be subjected to radical ideologies or deviant moral principles.  
3. Not really a policy position, but it is very telling that he will be very similar to Trump when it comes to immigration.

It's not the Republicans signing bogus FISA warrants and shadowbanning social media posts.


>Trump had a lot of complaints during his presidency. But you can’t arrest a guy for cheating on his wife, or arrested him so saying he can grab women by the crotch, but you can arrest him for Russian collusion. The RussiaHoax was the fake news they created to put him behind bars, but that’s not why people *hated* him. They hated well before anything regarding Russia ever came out. 

The hate for him only exploded once he got the nomination. There wasn't nearly that much negatively about him until the newsmedia fanned the flames.

For a billion dollars, you could literally just hand every single one of them a 30k check.  So lets triple it- 3 billion dollars and you could put each and every one of them in a mobile home- paid and clear.  That is a **third** of the current cost of Trump's additions to the border wall/fence.

I don’t disagree with a lot of the points being made, however from my perspective it’s not always that straightforward. The unfortunate truth is a lot of our homeless population suffers from severe mental health problems, drug addition, etc. and don’t want to be helped. 

If we cut every homeless person a check for $30k or $90k or whatever amount of money the conservative view is that a large sum of it won’t be spent on housing or necessities, but instead squandered on drugs, booze, and such. 

You and I agree that they need help, but from my perspective many of them prefer to live the way they are living. Mental health makes people do things, harmful things that wouldn’t make sense to someone thinking rationally. Short of locking them up, which I assure you nobody wants to do, how do we force our help upon them? It’s one of the world problems that’s super easy to see, but nearly impossible to solve.

The focus of the article is the fact that Uganda already has laws to prosecute rapists and child rapists, however in this case they're applying the aggravated homosexuality law to seek a greater punishment purely on the grounds that the crimes occured between same sex individuals. That is the newsworthy element, and that's why it is the headline's focus.

If anything, it's fairly neutral. If you believe all rapists should receive the harshest punishments, the article is showing you how heterosexual rapes receive lighter punishments in Uganda and this might be interest to you; if you are LGBT+ or an ally and don't want to see other LGBT+ unfairly targetted, it might be of interest to you also.

If anything, this community check undermines the article by making it appear that CNN is trying to paint a dishonest picture and discouraging people from engaging with it honestly.",2023-08-30 06:44:52

"Yes, this is wrong and bad. Yes, it's because the law criminalizes homosexuality. It was already a crime in Uganda to rape, including raping a minor. Yes, it was already punishable by death in that country. Yes, it is an unambiguously good thing that these people who are accused of rape are facing some semblance of justice. No, punishing people for rape as being homosexuality is obviously bad. Also, it's worth noting that these people are still innocent until they are proven guilty. Don't you all agree that a person should be considered innocent until they are proven guilty?

Apparently the users of /r/conservative care a great deal about what happens in Africa now. Just to verify my impression, I went through the last 200 post titles to this subreddit- not one single other mention of Africa or any politics regarding that continent or any nations in it. I wonder how far back I would have to go to find any of you to pretend to care about Africa again? For that matter, did any of you read the article?

A couple weeks ago a user completely blew gov Kemp out of the water after Kemp claimed Trump lost the election in GA and the election was totally secure. They exposed Kemp as a blatant liar.

One problem - a community note was quickly added to the user's tweet to ""debunk"" it, but that community note itself was wrong and the user was right. So instead of Kemp looking bad, the top comment debunking him was fact checked false and it made Kemp look good. Fast forward a week, the fact check is now gone but the damage was done and Kemp was protected. Of course they never added a fact check to Kemp's tweet even though he lied.

The police told lawyers that the 41-year-old was unable to provide consent for sexual conduct due to his “mental status” and therefore a victim, making the alleged offence “aggravated”. However, according to a spokesperson from the Office of the DPP, the “victim was a 41-year-old male living with a disability.” Lawyers said that the police did not provide any evidence to substantiate this assertion.

Where were these people's parents?? Did they expect the world to adapt for them??",2023-06-12 21:35:39

"Are these satirical requests just to point out the absurdity of making others bow down to your preferences? It would honestly be very funny to plant people who could make increasingly bizarre requests that get taken absolutely seriously by everyone else. It would be especially funny if they continually moved the goalposts or got into a passive aggressive squabble about basic traditional gestures. It looks like they already banned clapping, but it would be great if someone brought up how distracting everyone waving their hands in the air was. Whatever they do to replace that could then be shifted to more draconian measures by more complaints. It would be hilarious to see.",2023-06-12 22:20:57
"Please please don’t underestimate or misinterpret what is going on here. There is a lot of hate behind this apparent goofiness. They aren’t harmless snowflakes, they’re hateful, fanatical activists.

Cool”

Edit: And just for the record, I am legitimately on the spectrum but I would never consider telling everyone the room in a cringe manner to quit the chatter. My mental obstacles are not everyone else’s bullshit to deal with. These people with autism at this conference were clearly never taught how to deal with distractions.",2023-06-12 19:11:14

"I don't agree with things being this way, but not out of hate, seeing as this is r/conservative, whose entire ideology is based on hate, I would like to give my analytical opinion:


As someone in the ASD:

Since I started my journey of self-exploration and mental health counseling, I've become a lot more understanding of ""liberals"" ""allies"" ""leftists"" and else, and even though I share ideas with these groups; their overly exaggerated pursue of inclusivity and freedom, although justified and altruistic, gets to the point of absurdity. 
Yes we all need help. Yes we all deserve respect. Yes our necessities are valid.
But as my mom put it after my diagnosis; we all have something going on, just look at me (pointing at her glasses), and your brother (he's been hospitalized due to depression before). Now, she's someone with 3 degrees including medicine and biology so she sure understands that being in the ASD is nowhere comparable with being near-sighted, so probably was saying it just to make feel better. Nonetheless she makes a good point; What did I do when I started being affected by near-sightedness? Did I ask for every piece of text to be enlarged? Did I ask everyone to come closer so I could see them? No, I just got glasses and sat at the front row. 

Same goes for ASD. I've felt infantilized before and I absolutely despise it, but what do I do? I explain how I feel and say ""I understand what's making you infantilize me, so while I will stop doing it, I would appreciate if you'd be more thoughtful of your actions"". If I'm with someone I trust, I can unmask, and that's awesome, but whenever I can't or shouldn't, I don't. Unmasking is not always voluntary, and sometimes it has consequences. I take responsibility of those consequences and it is up the other person to forgive me, whether they believe it was my divergent brain what caused it or not.",2023-06-13 10:34:27

So while I’m not saying anything definitive about these particular people, it is 100% possible that many of them may in fact be in that vague “gray” area of mental disability, which contributes to some of their behavior.

Given my Conservative flair, you are likely surprised that I'm pro-choice to some extent.

I don't see abortion as a religious argument, but rather a secular, moral issue. ""Is this murder?"" comes down to your personal morals. And, if we're honest, it can be expressed as a fraction. ""How does this murder affect my morals / How having this baby affects my life going forward.

Stops.

"Before blowing up in size and popularity, Antiwork basically had two types of people:

* Those who feel work and a work oriented society are not giving the results it should - i.e. we work far too much for what we get out of it. And though that's easy to disagree with, it's a valid viewpoint. You mention prehistoric hunter-gatherers, but they only worked about four hours every day. The rest of the day was resting and leisure time. They died in childbirth when they were twenty, but still, to some people that might be worth it. Rousseau already argued the same in the 17th century, so, you know, fair enough.
* Those who agree that work is a necessary part of life and dislike that necessity. Just like sometimes I'm watching a movie and I have to get up to pee and I think ""Damn I wish I didn't have to pee"". I acknowledge the necessity of peeing but I still dislike it. Also fair enough, right?

Then the sub got more popular (because it's *fun* to vent about having to work), and a new group arrived:

* Those who don't necessarily dislike work, but dislike shitty managers, terrible working conditions, gold-hoarding billionaires, etc. It's not really in line with being ""anti"" work, and they forced the sub to become far more constructive and moderate than it was (and futilely tried to turn it into a ""movement""), but fair enough. Constructive criticism on society is worthwhile.

But inevitably this new group invited a smaller group, which is the one you described:

* Those who dislike having to work (fair enough) and think society needs to change (fair enough) *to work for them* (not fair!) And these people aren't really helpful, and also kind of disingenuous about what they want.",2023-06-13 07:15:27

"> So... Killing siblings and first born, and women raping their drunken fathers is okay?

I won't go down the list because I don't feel like writing a 1000 word post nor can those topics be covered properly in a Reddit post (and I'm sure someone else will address them), but I will address this one that is the most ridiculous.

Please share where in the Bible it shows that part of Christian morality is *an acceptance* of murdering siblings, children, and women raping their drunken fathers. It shares stories about these things, but it doesn't say they're good.

* **Killing siblings**. I assume you mean Cain and Abel. God banished Cain from his home, made it so he couldn't farm for food (Cain was a tiller), and forced him to wander the Earth.

* **First born killings**. Presumably, you mean Abraham attempting to sacrifice Isaac. In this case, God never intended for Abraham to sacrifice his son. It was a test of faith, and he always intended to stop Abraham before the act was done. And as a reward for his faith, God blessed Abraham with ""descendants as countless as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore.""

* **Women raping their drunken fathers**. Lot's daughters? Nowhere does the Bible say this act was okay.

Not to mention that the 10 Commandments literally refute your examples. Don't Murder and Honor Your Father and Mother.

Just because the Bible has stories of bad events doesn't mean that it condones those events. You have to read the Bible in context.",2023-09-26 07:24:00

"In theory, but the crap they're throwing at Trump, half that shit isn't even a legitimate crime.

They have nothing, just a shitload of more election manipulation.",2023-09-26 00:50:21
"So you're getting accused by your government behind closed doors without being given the opportunity to defend yourself.

What scares me the most is how many people here are OK with this.",2023-09-26 00:11:42

\- Everyone who has a negligent discharge, immediately before realizing that it was in fact loaded.",2023-09-25 15:11:07
"Yeah but when you’re dealing with firearms you always act as is they are. 

There are *many* cases of someone not realizing a gun was loaded and someone ends up shot. 

If you always act like the gun is loaded you don’t need to worry about the one time you might forget it actually is loaded.",2023-09-25 14:55:08
"ok. but always assume it's loaded.
 it's not that hard",2023-09-25 14:29:46
Yeah those two things are extremely comparable - good job!,2023-09-25 16:43:03
Why is Biden coming into a conversation about Trump?,2023-09-25 22:38:42
"Ok, so this article says we shouldn't use COVID times to judge Trump's economics, but then fails to acknowledge the impact it's had on Biden's economics. Trump was gifted a thriving economy and it continued to thrive under Trump until COVID. Biden entered under a globally collapsing economy under COVID. You can't in good faith draw a fair comparison between Trump 3 years in and Biden 3 years in. There are very different circumstances that are at play. This isn't to suggest Biden or Trump were better or worse. I'm not trying to have that argument right now. I'm simply pointing out the obvious that it's not a fair comparison either.",2023-09-26 04:42:40

As far as I'm concerned Trump is guilty.,2023-09-26 05:18:23
"You are accused by the Government, yes, but you are indicted by your fellow citizens, that’s the point of a jury.

Edit: that keeps the government from doing what they want, because the people have a say in what goes to court and what not, which accusations are worth investigating and which have no foundation.",2023-09-26 01:07:23
I think you’re right. I’ve never heard it in real life.,2023-09-25 23:53:31

This thread has been enlightening that even a bunch of Trumpers can't agree on basic firearm safety is as good of argument for more gun control as I've ever seen.,2023-09-25 18:11:46
[deleted],2023-09-25 15:41:05
It's about drilling habits if anything even if you are 110% certain the firearm isn't loaded (because you checked).  You don't want to ever get complacent with a firearm in that off-chance it is loaded and you aren't aware.,2023-09-25 15:35:12
"Yeah, no. That doesn’t work here.

Biden is **currently** the president of the US. Or at least, he’s pretending to be.

Acknowledging how he is **currently** destroying your country isn’t even in the same universe as the left’s obsession with Donald Trump.",2023-09-26 00:12:41
"Prove it.

The corrupt left in America has sunk *hundreds of millions of dollars* into trying to pin a crime on Donald Trump, to no avail.

They desperately tried to make the Russia collusion hoax stick, but truth and reality prevailed. 

They eventually had to admit that Clinton made the whole thing up. That is an example of treason and election interference.

Your country is going to absolute hell, all because almost half of its population consists of braindead, CNN-obsessed lunatics. 

The USA has morphed into a horror show. Its political left has lost all sense of reality. It’s unbelievable for the rest of us to witness.

You behave like feral animals, screeching and mobbing people who dare to acknowledge reality and burst your bubbles of delusion. It’s utterly unhinged.",2023-09-26 00:22:07

Many of the attitudes in Christianity and Islam overlap quite well (aside from specific beliefs of course).

"This is true to some extent I think, though I wouldn't say they compete in the ""culture war"" quite like we do. Other big parts of this relationship are military strength in the region, trade partnership when it comes to American weapons, and ""enemy of my enemy"" with Iran. Trump backs the Saudis to be the big dog in the Middle East. Biden has taken an impotent but negative stance publicly against Saudi Arabia for human rights, a negative stance against oil in general, and his Middle East policy is as impotent as his rhetoric. Trump is super pro-Saudi in meaningful ways and they dig him for it.",2024-03-22 18:51:52

The Saudi King was presenting him with a medal and he stooped to let the Saudi King put it on him. You can even tell he does his best to avoid an actual bow. Instead of bowing his head, which would have been the easy thing, he bends his knees to try and keep his body as upright as he can.

For comparison, this was Obama's bow.

"They said, “Mr. President, Sir… Mr. President nobody has ever touched the Crown Prince… no one. You can’t touch him, Sir, no one can touch him. No one has ever touched him other than his close family, and even then…”

Maybe his doctor? You have to think someone would’ve touched him, no? ‘Maybe his doctor’, I said. “Sir, his doctor is especially appointed by the head Imam. He is granted special rights, and even then he must wear gloves specially prepared by the Imam.”

I asked, ‘what kind of gloves?’ “Oh, Sir, very special gloves, Sir.” ‘I don’t need any gloves. The Crown Prince and I… I know him very well. Mohammad… ‘Mo’, I call him… Mo will not mind if I touch him. I don’t need any special gloves.’

“Sir, please Sir, it’s very important”- ‘I’m going to touch him like no one’s ever touched him before. He’s going to say ‘Hey you know this isn’t so bad. What have I been missing out on? The President just touched me. I like The President.’ It’ll be terrific. You know he likes me very much. He always says, ‘Mr. President, with all of my palaces I still have nothing like your towers. Beautiful towers. We should do some deals together.’ I then I’ll touch him. It’ll be terrific . No one will have ever seen anything else like it. “Sir, please, no” - ‘Hold my drink.”",2024-03-22 18:27:06
