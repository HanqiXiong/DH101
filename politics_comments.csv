That includes Heller, McDonald, Citizens United, and Dobbs.

That also ignores every 5-4 ruling he makes from here on out that states like CA can basically ignore.

"> Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall were the last of the Court's liberals. Old and ill, though reluctant to give up the fight, they retired. The final act to create a conservative Supreme Court was President Bush's nomination to replace Marshall. He chose a black conservative, Clarence Thomas. Despite dramatic testimony from a former colleague, a young black law professor named Anita Hill, that Thomas had sexually harassed her, Thomas was approved by the Senate and now the Supreme Court moved even more decisively to the right.

https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinncarebu21.html

> In October 1991, Anita Hill testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee — then headed by Delaware Sen. Joe Biden — about allegations of sexual harassment she had made against Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas. She faced a panel made up entirely of white men as she recounted comments Thomas had made when the two worked together. Her claims were publicly dissected and often dismissed during the hearing. “You testified this morning, in response to Senator Biden, that the most embarrassing question involved — and this is not too bad — women’s large breasts,” then-Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter said to Hill at one point. “That is a word we use all the time.”

Also: 


> Fossett: The Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings were 30 years ago now. How does an experience like that affect you? In particular, does it diminish the moral authority of the court at all when you’ve had the kind of experiences you’ve had with someone on the court?

> Hill: I think it’s not just me personally that has doubts about the court now. The fact is that we have two sitting Supreme Court justices who have gone through hearings about sexual misconduct — one sexual assault allegation against Justice Kavanaugh, and then there were the Clarence Thomas hearings, which were focused on his behavior, which I would describe as sexual harassment. The question about integrity of the court isn’t just about me and Christine Blasey Ford; it’s about the American public’s confidence in the court. I think it’s been diminished for a lot of people, including myself and including Christine Blasey Ford, but I don’t want to speak for her. But I think for the public, there has been some reduction in belief in the integrity of our court because they don’t necessarily now trust the way people get placed on Supreme Court.

> The court really is only as strong as all of the people who are sitting on it. So having two sitting justices whose integrity has been called into question is a blow to the court and the entire judicial system in this country.

She goes on to say:

> So, the problem really is bigger than an individual problem. It’s bigger than one single behavior — sexual harassment — which I think most people associate with me. And what I’m trying to do in this book is to connect all of us. And that’s happened almost organically because I’ve heard from people who have had experiences in each of those institutions. They have helped me to understand that **if we don’t address all of those problems, we’re never going to be able to stop one individual problem like sexual harassment in the workplace.**",2023-04-06 12:45:32

This is the closest comparable situation, just 54 years ago, for a fraction of the value that Thomas accepted.  

President Biden and Merrick Garland should follow the precedent established by Richard Nixon and John Mitchell and call for Thomas to resign.

If one makes the assumption that a SCOTUS justice can *eventually* reverse upon appeal anything against them, then it is understandable to make the argument that it is required to remove that power from them via job termination to ensure ""justice"".

But keep in mind that depending upon the crime, the SCOTUS justice could be imprisoned while awaiting that appeal.  Things would get rather weird.

deposition. Under that specific definition, sexual relations 
occurs ""when the person knowingly engages in or causes contact

sexual desire of any person.'' Thus, the President

gratify the sexual desire of ""any person.''

Your property tax is how TX politicians can rail against taxes at the top of their lungs, and then make sure your appraisal goes up by the max it's allowed to every year as a back door tax hike.

Personally, I think property tax is pretty terrible. It's the only tax that can render someone homeless who has paid off their home. This, and the yearly backdoor tax hike of property taxes, hits those on a fixed income or those who could barely afford their home hardest.
  
  
Edit: A huge feature of the property tax racket in TX is that no legislator has to be accountable for your compounding-year-over-year tax hike. Nobody votes on your taxes increasing 10% this year, then 10% on that higher value the next year and so on.

"It's *easy* to use loopholes to go lower:

* Buy
* Borrow
* Die

Buy, or somehow acquire shares in a company (say by founding it).

Borrow money using your shares as collateral.  Because this is borrowing, not income, you don't pay any taxes on it.  You might pay some interest, but lately interest rates for borrowing have been insanely low, and in any case they're orders of magnitude lower than taxes.

Die.  Your estate can sell the shares you own immediately and pay essentially no tax.  The value of the shares is set at the time you die, so if they're sold 1 month later, that's tax on 0.1% growth of the value, not the 200% or whatever during your lifetime.

Voila, tens of billions of dollars in spending money for a centi-billionaire and no income taxes owed.

This is just one well known loophole.  There are undoubtedly more loopholes that only the accountants to the rich know about.

"The problem is capital flight. For example in France:

>A 2006 article in The Washington Post gave several examples of private capital leaving France in response to the country's wealth tax. The article also stated, ""Eric Pinchet, author of a French tax guide, estimates **the wealth tax earns the government about $2.6 billion a year but has cost the country more than $125 billion in capital flight** since 1998.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight",2023-03-08 23:54:19
"To explain this. You get some stock for $10/share. During your lifetime, it appreciates to $150/share. But you don't sell it. 

Then you die and leave it as inheritance to a child. For tax purposes, their cost basis is now $150. They would only ever pay taxes on the gains above $150. Nobody ever  pays the taxes on the $140 capital gains from  $10 to $150.

It is a great way to shield tons of income from taxation. There is no US federal inheritance tax, and all assets under $12 million are exempt from the US estate tax.

The simple answer is that an estate should settle taxes before inheritance is paid out.

(Edit to add... Now the child who inherited the $150 stock sells it all for no tax, uses some of the profit to buy some other stock for $10/share, and lives on the rest of the profit for the rest of their lives. When they die, the stock the purchased for $10 is now  again worth $150 and passes to their children without taxes. Generational wealth can continue virtually forever without taxation.)",2023-03-08 21:56:13

"historical calvinism is the secret sauce behind capitalism. it suggests that divinity/holyness (being en route to heaven) is predetermined and reflected in increased worldly success, rather than the other way around. that is, worldly success is the result of having inherently been holy from the start, and so can be used as a kind of yardstick for how ""good"" you are as a person. This takes money from being a means to an end to being the end in and of itself. all of a sudden, surplus wealth beyond practical utility becomes desirable.

Our relationship to wealth is fundamentally linear, whereas their relationship is exponential in nature. I like to put it like this: ""Lets say you make shoes for a living. In an hour, you can turn $10 worth of materials into a pair of shoes you can sell for $40. If you want to turn $100 into $400, you need to make 10 pairs of shoes, which takes 10 times as long: it can only grow linearly. On the other hand, a rich capitalist who can pay 10 employees to make 10 pairs of shoes, can reasonably expect to be able to pay 100 employees to make 100 pairs of shoes in the same amount of time, (crucially assuming they have the capital to do so, which is the limiting factor of why none of us can do that). This allows them to grow their wealth in an exponential fashion"" If you know anything about linear growth vs exponential growth, the fact that the rich are getting stupidly richer at the expense of all of us should be no surprise.",2023-03-08 20:22:47

"Luxury real estate can easily exceed $14.3M, and, like most rich people, you're probably going to want multiple homes. Then you have to consider upkeep. As a rough rule, upkeep on property is ballpark 5%~ of it's price, so if I end up owning $30M in real estate, that's $1.5M/year just to maintain it.

Luxury cars cost hundreds of grand, and you might want several. Never mind if you're a car enthusiast/collector.

You're going to want to travel a lot more, probably. Even if you're slumming it with the rest of us in airliners, you probably want to pricier tickets. That could easily end up being hundreds of grand a year when you consider taking friends and family with you. Never mind private jet travel... and that's renting, not owning.

Heck, while we're on family and friends, maybe you want to provide for them too? Just my parents, to give them the sort of retirement they've dreamt of would cost millions of dollars to set up in real estate. Then giving them a good quality of life, travel, nice vehicles, covering the cost of that real estate, etc. could be a couple hundred grand a year.

You're probably going to want to hire a bunch of people too. You know, the normal stuff like cleaners and maintenance... but also drivers, private chef, security, etc.  Easily hundreds of grand a year.

Luxury products are also significant more expensive than what most people wear. Clothing, jewelry, furniture... you know there are couches that are worth more than new cars, right?

Expenses eating out and partying can be hundreds of grand a year even modestly if you go out with a few people a few times a week to more expensive places. And remember, it may not be you. You got a family? It could be one of your kids.

Lots of us already spend some amount of money supporting creators and projects we care about, and give money to charities we believe in. How much would you scale that up if you had $14.3M/year to do it with?

Then there's hobbies/passion stuff. That can vary wildly. Like, you into photography/videography? You can easily drop tens of grand or more on that. Don't even get me started on if you want to make movies.

Like, again, $14.3M/year is a lot of money. It'd be a little hard to spend that much money.

But the kicker is the math on that's screwy. A billionaire doesn't have $14.3M/year to spend. If they've got that invested, then even modestly, they could have more like $50M/year to spend, without even eating into their principal.

It'd be very hard to spend that much or more a year, and by the time you're talking about several billion, it's basically impossible without considering expenses that aren't ""for you"" anymore.",2023-03-08 21:53:58

"I think you should second-guess your conclusion. 

There was a post on Reddit sometime ago where someone categorized different levels of wealth based on their experiences working with the wealthy. 

Under $10 or 20 million, you basically still live the same lifestyle as everyone else. Sure you have a nicer house and nicer cars and take nicer vacations and you don't really have to worry about money but you still drive your own car and pay a mortgage on your house etc. 

Somewhere around $100 million there's a shift where your time becomes more important than money.  The marginal value of money is sufficiently low to you that you can pay for things without thinking about the cost. You have enough money to hire to pay to make your life easier for all sorts of mundane details.   You have a staff. A cook for your house, a maid for your house and a driver for your car etc.   You want to take a vacation but it's inconvenient that your house isn't ready? You can hire a staff to stay there and make sure it's ready the whole summer. You have full-time people who help with your finances.  But you can't ignore the money entirely. 

As you approach a billion you reach the point where money is no object for the most part. You can afford whatever you want.  Your limitations are social and political rather than monetary.You live essentially like a head of state. With teams of people whose job it is to ensure that your every need is met before you think of it.  

I would add another category and suggest that at the true apex, where you're talking tens and hundreds of billions of dollars that those people do literally have the same power as heads of state.  Their security may not rival the US military but the logistics are pretty similar. If they leave they can get picked up in a helicopter to fly to the plane get on the plane flower they want have everything arranged for them when they get there and go home the same way.",2023-03-09 03:57:47

Rich white plantation owners convinced poor illiterate white southerners to fight and die for their right to own slaves for no other reason than the alleged bond they share due to their skin color. If the masses of white working class people in this country voted for progressive candidates their lives would improve greatly. They don’t because they’ve been brainwashed into believing they have some kinship with white business owner “job creators”.  Republicans understand this which is why they suppress history, especially black American history, whenever possible.

"Yeah I didn't really want to dive into the small details of this, but my point is that people like a US president or Putin would be harnessing the full power of very-expensive-to-get-to-this-point state of the art military, equipment, technology, etc.  Very wealthy drug warlords in some countries can have a vast military, but it will be more a headcount of guys and whatever hardware they are able to buy from a weapons dealer.  The countries that have invested literally trillions of dollars worth of time and effort into R&D and can make the weapons/equipment/tech - and a leader of that country can have everything at their fingertips if needed is what I consider the hidden cost - very few people on this planet are in a position to harness such ""wealth"", and billionaires can't buy it either.  My point is that Putin is absolutely one of these people that has it, so he is way above any sum of money anyone calculates he is ""worth"".

The staff a billionaire would hire to run their lives, from your point, turns out to be the government and military for a person like Putin.  I mean would you call that a billionaire lifestyle?

"Summarizing it the briefest way, the point I'm making is that I think someone like Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates could have almost every bit of the personal power that a head of state has. 

Sure they are bound by laws to some degree but so is the president. 

Look at Eric Prince as an example. He's not worth even anything close to tens of billions of dollars but he functionally lives outside of the law.   After his legal situation in the US got precarious he relocated to Abu Dhabi and lives in the United Arab Emirates where he provides private security to the elite as part of his keep.    Although he sold the renamed version of blackwater, he still runs a private security company with hundreds of mercenaries and has his fingers in conflicts all over the globe.    The proof is out there to charge him with war crimes but actually arresting him and bringing him to trial would be exceedingly difficult.

If Jeff Bezos wanted to buy a Private Island and become a bond villan, it's not lack of money that would stop him.",2023-03-09 04:50:39

*****
> BISMARCK - Ten days after narrowly defeating a bill to provide free school lunches to low-income K-12 students, the North Dakota Senate approved legislation to increase the amount of money lawmakers and other state employees receive in meal reimbursements.

> The Senate voted 26-21 on Thursday, April 6, to pass Senate Bill 2124, which would raise the meal reimbursements received by state employees during travel within North Dakota.

> That&#039;s a hike of nearly 29% on the current reimbursement rate of $35. Thirteen Republican senators, including Majority Leader David Hogue and Assistant Majority Leader Jerry Klein, voted to increase meal reimbursements after voting against the free school lunch bill.

In addition people ignore the circular flow of money. Money spent on kids food goes to distributors, truck drivers, farmers and a host of employees etc. It isn't just lost. In fact there is a multiplier effect.

In Kentucky, the Democrat governor expanded Medicaid to cover vision, dental and hearing with a cost of $38m but with federal money of $36m to offset it. The state houses rejected the plan despite it only having a net cost of $2m. There are extremely poor residents in counties in Kentucky for whom the cost of dentures is prohibitive.

It's not *""FIRST we solve class, THEN we handle the other things,""* it's *""all of our struggles are interrelated and subject to the class system. By achieving class victories, we can achieve victories for everyone.""*

It's intersectional. You can't discuss class in a vacuum, so solving women's issues, for example, inherently includes solving class issues and vice-versa, because woman are a social and economic class and you are solving *women's class issues.*
Any solution that will arise in regards to class and resource distribution must be informed intersectionally, because that solution will dictate how our resources are distributed. If we don't agree that, for example, POC have been dominated and exploited by the state since its inception, then that solution will only solve problems for *some* of us. People won't really care about your class struggle if you haven't developed an understanding of their issues, and therefore how class factors into those issues, because whatever solution you want to implement doesn't necessarily solve their problems.

**Basically:** Solidarity is the name of the game and we can *and should* walk and chew gum at the same time. Discussions outside of class are not distractions, they are valuable perspectives and philosophies that allow us to analyze and solve the class issue more effectively *for everyone* as well as build community with our fellow humans.

At least in North Dakota, there's already an issue with younger people having to move away since there aren't good enough job opportunities or decent enough wages to match up with housing costs outside of Fargo, which also isn't the greatest right now for those prospects. Even though Fargo is pretty progressive and the largest town in ND, the place would NOT do well with 40k random people from California suddenly turning up in terms of housing and jobs. It'd cause tons of homelessness, both with Californians and existing residents, and overall it'd be very bad for everyone. Doesn't matter what imaginary housing stipends and grants exist in your mind, this idea wouldn't help the problems in these states and many of the people from CA would end up having to move elsewhere anyways. I believe a similarly bad scenario would happen in WY and AK if this idea was actually attempted in real life, but I'm further away from those states so I don't know as many specifics.


This all isn't even mentioning the sociological concept of ideas not being accepted by a culture if it comes from people forcing themselves in from outside of the culture, rather than support for the idea naturally developing from people within the culture (i.e. the progressive people already living in North Dakota or Wyoming that are from there and care about the state). This push for progress is already happening with the youth and smart people in ND, WY, and AK, by the way, along with the amazing people who've already been actively helping with the fight for progress in red states they're from. This idea of yours wouldn't help out with the fight though.",2023-04-07 11:47:27

"Conservatives are more likely to attribute success to work ethic because they have lost *empathy* for other people.

Conservatism stems from fear. When you are fearful you aren’t sympathetic to other people’s needs. And religious conservatives are the most fearful of them all.

People fall back on religion when they can’t rationalize their own life experience. It’s a cop out to avoid explaining your beliefs, behaviors, and subjects you don’t understand.

Recall a time you were faking a skill. Let’s say: cheating on a math test, lying on a resume about your experience, or exaggerating your athleticism. Dishonesty generates anxiety in most normal people. It does this because humans are social creatures and want to be trusted and accepted by their fellow humans. Nobody wants a liar who can’t be trusted. There is a buildup of fear and anxiety when you know you are being dishonest for fear of being ‘found out’ and rejected.

What does this have to do with religion you might be asking? Religion is a placeholder for any lack of knowledge. It fills a void but also generates anxiety if the person doesn’t 100% believe in what they are saying or has doubts.

Fear and anxiety kind of go hand-in-hand and influence our fight or flight response..our most primitive emotion. An elevated level of adrenaline makes people:


1.	Physically or verbally aggressive
2.	Less willing to cooperate
3.	More intolerant of other people or ideas


This happens because adrenaline is there to protect you. To get you to safety as quickly as possible or prepare you to take action that will protect your physical well-being.

In society today, physical threats are mostly non-existent, but you can still generate plenty of fear and anxiety through other issues. Just turn on Faux News. Scare the people and offer a ‘solution’ to secure the vote. The most vulnerable are the ones who are already slightly broken.

There’s a reason religion is concentrated in conflict zones and lower quality of life regions.  Look at the most religious countries ex: (Iran, Syria, Turkey) vs. the least religious (Finland, Sweden, Norway). People in Middle Eastern countries are much more fearful and uncertain about their realities than Nordic countries are.

Also think about the two party system here in the U.S. What issues do Democrats and Conservatives have difficulty seeing eye-to-eye on? Almost every single controversial issue is centered around fear. Fear of death (religion), fear of other countries (war/immigration), fear of other people (gun rights), fear of destroying our planet (climate change).

If you already have elevated levels of adrenaline, the added fear and anxiety associated with these issues become overwhelming and people ‘turn inwards’ meaning they stop empathizing. Their own safety becomes priority #1. Their own ideology becomes a matter of fact.

The antidote is gaining awareness for yourself and the world around you. Connecting and empathizing with people and more tolerance for the diversity of life. This makes you more confident about your own reality and the unknown.",2023-04-07 08:11:39

"For those confused what the crime here was, I wrote this:

It's important to note here, that paying hush money is not illegal.  Paying hush money to bury a story is not illegal.  Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.

Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.

Falsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.  

The issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.  

It would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.  

The jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.

Essentially the jury found:

* 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal)
* 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal)
* 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal)
* 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over)
* 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york)
* 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime)
* 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony
* 8)  Trump did this 34 times.",2024-05-30 15:43:04

We still have a few weeks to hear sentencing, and he will undoubtedly appeal, which could last well into 2025.

This IS history. Polling saying voters are partisan and unmoved doesn't make it any less significant.

For starters, it's not a ""hush money"" case, as the media has latched onto. It's an *election interference* case, and these are *felonies.*

He worked to illegally cover up stories that could have easily swung the 2016 election, which was won by a few thousand votes in a few states, and could have altered the course of American history. It encapsulates everything about Trump and is the beginning to his criminal history saga regarding the Presidency.

Of course, this is a man who would’ve coasted to re-election if he just acted like a normal president during COVID. 

But I digress, instead he is going to use this press conference tomorrow to attack the prosecutors, the judge, the judge’s daughter, the jury, the witnesses, the Biden administration, Trump’s defense team, Mike Pence, the Taco Bell dog and really anyone else who pops into his demented old head. 

And I don’t see how any judge doesn’t give him jail time after that.  Acceptance of responsibility is a huge deal when it comes to sentencing. And Trump, claiming to be a Christian, literally said he cannot thing of a single time he’s ever had to ask God for forgiveness or repent. He’s not going to accept responsibility.

"trump posted: trump says “Not only did this HIGHLY CONFLICTED, BIASED Judge, Juan Merchan, prevent me from presenting the fact that I did not take a Tax Deduction on the Legal Expense (which was marked, correctly, as a Legal Expense), the Judge also did not allow my lawyers to get Tax Records from the former attorney, whose name I am not allowed to mention due to the UnConstitutional Gag Order imposed upon me. ELECTION INTERFERENCE! WITCH HUNT!”

here’s the facts: Donald Trump's statement contains several inaccuracies and misleading claims. Here is a fact-check based on the provided sources:

### Claim 1: ""Judge Juan Merchan prevented me from presenting the fact that I did not take a Tax Deduction on the Legal Expense.""
- **Fact**: Judge Merchan did not prevent Trump from presenting evidence related to tax deductions. The judge's instructions to the jury included explanations about what constitutes falsifying business records and the intent to defraud, which involves the intent to commit or conceal another crime, such as tax fraud[8][11][18]. There is no indication that Trump was barred from presenting specific evidence about tax deductions.

### Claim 2: ""The Legal Expense (which was marked, correctly, as a Legal Expense).""
- **Fact**: The prosecution argued that the payments to Michael Cohen were falsely labeled as legal expenses to conceal their true nature as reimbursements for hush money payments to Stormy Daniels[15][19]. The jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records, indicating they did not accept the defense's argument that the expenses were correctly marked[15].

### Claim 3: ""The Judge also did not allow my lawyers to get Tax Records from the former attorney.""
- **Fact**: There is no evidence that Judge Merchan prevented Trump's lawyers from obtaining tax records from Michael Cohen. The judge did limit the testimony of certain witnesses, such as former Federal Election Commission chairman Bradley Smith, but this was related to the scope of their testimony, not the ability to obtain records[4][5][10].

### Claim 4: ""I am not allowed to mention due to the UnConstitutional Gag Order imposed upon me.""
- **Fact**: The gag order imposed by Judge Merchan restricts Trump from making public statements about potential witnesses, jurors, court employees, or their families to ensure a fair trial and protect the safety of those involved[2][3][14]. This order has been upheld by the appellate court, which found it to be a necessary measure to balance Trump's free speech rights with the need for a fair trial[2][3].

### Claim 5: ""ELECTION INTERFERENCE! WITCH HUNT!""
- **Fact**: Trump has repeatedly claimed that the charges against him are politically motivated and constitute election interference. However, the prosecution and the court have maintained that the charges are based on evidence and legal principles, not political bias[1][2][3][15]. The jury's unanimous guilty verdict further supports the legitimacy of the legal process[15].

In summary, Trump's claims about Judge Merchan's actions and the nature of the trial are not supported by the facts. The judge's rulings and the gag order were implemented to ensure a fair trial and protect the integrity of the judicial process.

>Rep. Jim Jordan who chairs the House Judiciary panel, railed against the verdict shortly after it was delivered in a [post on X](https://x.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1796287911869977011).

>""The verdict is a travesty of justice,"" the Ohio Republican wrote. ""The Manhattan kangaroo court shows what happens when our justice system is weaponized by partisan prosecutors in front of a biased judge with an unfair process, designed to keep President Trump off the campaign trail and avoid bringing attention to President Biden’s failing radical policies.""

>Trump will be ""vindicated on appeal,"" Jordan added.

I'm speechless at both the irony of the Chairman of the House *Judiciary* Committee calling a unanimous verdict by a jury, the core bedrock of the criminal justice system, a ""travesty of justice"" and his complete lack of self-awareness for being so shamelessly partisan and vindictive himself while claiming that's what the Manhattan DA's Office did here.",2024-05-30 14:48:34

I genuinely don’t get why republicans are so devoted to one man. In the past we would just move onto another candidate who we believe can win. Now it’s Trump or nothing. No matter what he does there’s always justification for it and he’s the man to run. His own daughter is the co-chair of the RNC. He’s ingrained himself into the fabric of the Republican Party and turned it into the Trump party. If he’s elected again and can’t run for a third term then the next republican president will just be a puppet for him. Not to mention the chastising of republicans that don’t support him (RINO’s) which is what drove me to switch to democrat. If there’s any republicans reading this please let me know what you think of this I’m genuinely curious of the other sides thoughts,2024-05-30 15:14:34

"As a lawyer who's often a skeptic of our legal system, this verdict is a breath of fresh air. Enormous kudos to Judge Merchan, Alvin Bragg, and most of all to the jury for issuing what will stand as one of the most consequential verdicts in American history.

Despite what you'll see a lot of non-lawyers claim, I expect to see Trump to do some time for this. He isn't an average defendant, this isn't an average crime, and Judge Merchan has a truly historic opportunity to realize an oft-spoken but less frequently realized aspiration of the justice system: no-one is above the law. Putting Trump away for even a few months will set an example for decades or centuries to come.

What comes next is this: Trump is going to lose the 2024 election. He was on shaky ground before this verdict and his chances won't survive the label of 'convicted felon.' Soon, mercifully, Donald Trump won't be our problem. 

But we aren't free of problems. We will need to reckon - and it will be *difficult* - with the reality that even as a felon, Trump will win many states and pull many tens of millions of votes. Those voters are our problem. They live outside of reality, willfully locked in a bubble of resentment and commercialized fear-mongering, and they will find another Donald Trump. Until as a country we're able to heal our polity, to bring these voters back to something that approximates reality, the danger hasn't passed.",2024-05-30 14:38:30

"What about Tamar, David's daughter, who was raped by her half-brother Amnon after a family member told him how to do it and get away with it?

"" Samuel 13:1-25 CEV
David had a beautiful daughter named Tamar, who was the sister of Absalom. She was also the half sister of Amnon, who fell in love with her. But Tamar was a virgin, and Amnon could not think of a way to be alone with her. He was so upset about it that he made himself sick. Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab always knew how to get what he wanted, and he said to Amnon, “What's the matter? You're the king's son! You shouldn't have to go around feeling sorry for yourself every morning.” Amnon said, “I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.” Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, ask him to send Tamar, so you can watch her cook something for you. Then she can serve you the food.” So Amnon went to bed and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, “Please, ask Tamar to come over. She can make some special bread while I watch, and then she can serve it to me.” David told Tamar, “Go over to Amnon's house and fix him some food.” When she got there, he was lying in bed. She mixed the dough, made the loaves, and baked them while he watched. Then she took the bread out of the pan and put it on his plate, but he refused to eat it. Amnon said, “Send the servants out of the house.” After they had gone, he said to Tamar, “Serve the food in my bedroom.” Tamar picked up the bread that she had made and brought it into Amnon's bedroom. But as she was taking it over to him, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me!” She answered, “No! Please don't force me! This sort of thing isn't done in Israel. It's disgusting! Think of me. I'll be disgraced forever! And think of yourself. Everyone in Israel will say you're nothing but trash! Just ask the king, and he will let you marry me.” But Amnon would not listen to what she said. He was stronger than she was, so he overpowered her and raped her.  


 Then Amnon hated her even more than he had loved her before. So he told her, “Get up and get out!” She said, “Don't send me away! That would be worse than what you have already done.” But Amnon would not listen. He called in his servant and said, “Throw this woman out and lock the door!” The servant made her leave, and he locked the door behind her. The king's unmarried daughters used to wear long robes with sleeves. Tamar tore the robe she was wearing and put ashes on her head. Then she covered her face with her hands and cried loudly as she walked away. Tamar's brother Absalom said to her, “How could Amnon have done such a terrible thing to you! But since he's your brother, don't tell anyone what happened. Just try not to think about it.”   


Tamar soon moved into Absalom's house, but she was always sad and lonely. When David heard what had happened to Tamar, he was very angry. But Amnon was his oldest son and also his favorite, and David would not do anything to make Amnon unhappy.   


Absalom treated Amnon as though nothing had happened, but he hated Amnon for what he had done to his sister Tamar. Two years later, Absalom's servants were cutting wool from his sheep in Baal-Hazor near the town of Ephraim, and Absalom invited all of the king's sons to be there. Then he went to David and said, “My servants are cutting the wool from my sheep. Please come and join us!” David answered, “No, my son, we won't go. It would be too expensive for you.” Absalom tried to get him to change his mind, but David did not want to go. He only said that he hoped they would have a good time.""

"Afaik, it's all based on a mistranslation.
>We all know the story of the Virgin Mary in the Bible, and the Immaculate Conception that led to the birth of baby Jesus. However there has recently been speculation regarding the use of the word “virgin” with regards to Mary. The reason for this speculation being that it has been discovered that in the original Hebrew text the word “ha-almah” was used, a word similar to the English “young” or “maid”. The mistranslation occurred when this text was translated into Greek, where the word “parthenos” meaning virgin is used. The Hebrew word for virgin is “bethulah” and cannot be found anywhere in the original Hebrew text, meaning that the original writer did not intend for it to be read as “virgin” but as “young” girl.

>This error in the text begs the question, was it really a mistake? Or was it purposeful? Taking into account that the word “virgin” is not in the original text it is quite a leap from young to virgin, especially in the context of religion. Moreover if this was only a mistake imagine a world where Mary was just an average, young girl. How much would this change things? On the other hand there are others that argue that it was not an error but that the word virgin was strategically chosen instead of the word young, the end result being that Mary was held above other women and led a holier existence.

>In his book Orpheus, the Hebrew scholar Salomon Reinach wrote that, “As early as the second century B.C. the Jews perceived the error and pointed it out to the Greeks; but the Church knowingly persisted in the false reading, and for over fifteen centuries she has clung to her error. The mystery and questions over the choice “virgin” remain unsolved to this day.

The word Satan just means adversary, and is really just used to refer to an unnamed character or group that stands in opposition to another character or important people in a story. 

Also while we are at it, the Devil doesn't translate to a singular being either, but instead either the wicked or worthless based on context. And the story of Lucifer is invented whole sale way after the Bible is written, as Lucifer is a Roman god's name and was mentioned a total of 1 time in the Bible, where it was used to describe the fall of a Babylonian king.

The article does not even try to discover what the word exactly meant in 1st century, when the Corinthians letter was written , but for a Greek speaker the meaning is instantly clear and it means homosexual and not a paederast.

"The original prohibition people point to is Leviticus 20:13. From Sefaria:

""If a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman, the two of them have done an abhorrent thing; they shall be put to death—and they retain the bloodguilt.""

Notable here are the use of ""ish"" in Hebrew, referring to a man, and ""zachar,"" which translates to male. Hence the ""man lies with a male"" line above.

Ish is used when talking about a male person who is neither under the age of legal participation in society, nor enslaved. In modern terms, a legal citizen.

Zachar is a general term meaning a male. Boy, adolescent, teenager, or adult, but in this context, refers to one unable to participate as a citizen in society. Had the writer indented to refer to an adult male citizen, an equal, they would have used ish again.

Also notably, in none of these Levitical prohibitions are the equivalent general term for _female_ used. All references to relations with the opposite gender use the isha, or woman. The language _does,_ however, directly reflect equivalent phrases used in Greek in the same period to refer to pederasty.

This phrasing would also forbid relationships between males of unequal standing.

I asked him about several stories in the Bible, and who was ""supposed"" to be what. And he gave all the answers that match what most people would say is good or bad.

Of course, it hadn't occurred to him that with the stories being what they are, the people aren't necessarily intended to be interpreted the same way he was looking at them.

The gospels also pose a bit of a conundrum from where and when he was born, as well as his lineage too.

So when you see a “Christian” railing about illegal immigrants, call them a sodomite and remind them of the sins of sodom towards foreigners.

"Also scholars have figured out (by comparing original Greek and Hebrew translations) that in the story where Abraham rescues Lot after he gets abducted from Sodom, it shows him randomly paying tribute to a high priest in Jerusalem… and then suddenly he’s back in Sodom in the next verse. When comparing the translations you can see that Sodom was changed to Salem, presumably because it didn’t look good to have Abraham paying tribute to a heathen king. So they changed it and just randomly inserted this high priest in Jerusalem before continuing the story. 

The reason why they changed it to Jerusalem specifically was because at the time there were two warring factions of priests/scribes. Showing Abraham giving tribute to a priest of Salem gave legitimacy to their faction (Levites) over the Samaritans Their goal was to drive out the Samaritans so they could have all the power and tithe money. Which they eventually succeeded at. 

So at that point it’s like.. major details are just being changed out of nowhere, characters are being added, locations changed. Who knows what all else was changed. But it 100% makes complete sense. Human greed, politics, and lust for power. The Bible wasn’t just a collection of fairy tales or exaggerated stories, it was a tool to win over the people and make money from the very beginning.

"The funny thing about this (well, not funny haha) is that he's right that this isn't necessarily a ""bombshell,"" because he did say effectively the same thing in public.  I mean, did anyone in this country ***not*** know that the Republicans were trying to steal the election?  Was anyone actually confused about why they were voting not to certify?  They were absolutely brazen about it.

And of course they were.  By doing it in public and declaring that they had the right to do it, they were using a classic fascist technique.  No one can ""catch you"" committing a crime if you walk into the public square and say ""I am doing this, and it's not a crime.""  If someone stands up and says ""of course that's a crime,"" then you just shout them down as ridiculous, because why would anyone be committing a crime in the public square?  Of course it's not a crime.  And if it is a crime, it shouldn't be.  Etc.

So, yeah, this isn't a bombshell.  We knew this already.  ***But***, that isn't a reason to ignore it.

"So, two things to bear in mind here moving forward:   
1. The average centrist/republican fox viewer isn't as dialed in to the fact Jan 6 was a coup, and all their politicians interact with fox news anchor regularly and coordinate strategy.   
2. The context is important.

What this recording does is really emphasize in no uncertain terms how corrupt this was, and how this was unambiguously a coup. This may have been obvious to you for awhile, but a lot of people that should have been paying attention weren't.  So it's not a bombshell to you, but for the ""rational skeptical both sides"" crew it removes some of their plausible deniability.  Here's why:

**What it appeared Cruz was doing to the uninformed with his original statement:** 

A politician observing the election and certain ""facts"" being reported, then organically deciding based on that reporting, they need to advocate for actions A, B, and C.  Then announcing what they think the next steps should be to the public and their colleagues.

**What Cruz was actually doing:**

A politician making their mind up in advance about what facts need to be disseminated in the media, regardless of whether they are actually facts. Then informing the media what to report, and how to make it look legit. Then laying out their plan, requesting the media adopt this narrative, and continue to coordinate so they can perform actions A, B, and C to further their agenda.  Then when the media didn't sign off on the plan behind closed doors, he instead decided to lobby for these actions on his existing public platform.  It's entirely possible, if he had more support from Fox, they would have played this much differently and been more effective at laying the groundwork for a coup.

Basically it highlights how much of a pre-planned plot this was.  And how there is no separation between  right-wing media and right-wing politicians.",2023-04-25 19:38:03

The anchor tried to talk him down.  It is late at night, I'm sure she'll call in the morning!  But the Trump guy wouldn't accept it.  ""NO!  She is destroying democracy!  She should have called the second the polls closed!  It's irresponsible to wait this long!"".

And Hunter, who was spiraling deep into drugs and whatever else at that point, didn't have the good judgment to refuse.

"lol when that shit was happening I had a roommate claim that ""it's not so bad!"" so I told him to nut up or shut up and let me waterboard him.

When I was at work, that fucker let our other roommates do ""waterboard lite"" to him, where they laid him down (horizontal), and splashed water on his face.

When they told me and described it I was mad because, first off, I wasn't there to see it happen.

And then, what they did definitely wouldn't rise to the point where you could seriously call it 'waterboarding', because it requires:

- having your hands bound (produces a psychological lack-of-freedom effect)
- the surface (board) you are on needs to be slanted *down* towards your head, preferably at like 30 degree angle or more (so higher blood pressure in your face and brain).
- a cloth over your face (to blind you *and* so that your facial nerves keep detecting the presence of water, and all air you pull in will be high in moisture content)
- someone dumping a *shitload* of water on your face. Like, a bucketful at a time.
- if you really want to make it realistic, have extremely loud noises (bad music, random industrial noises, etc) while the 'interrogator' is screaming confusing questions at you.

E. Jean says something like “ Jessica was a knockout 40 years ago and she is a knock out today.”

"Just want to say how thrilled I am for E. Jean Carroll! It took a fuckton of guts for her to take Trump to court for a decades-old rape, and I’m so glad she finally got a smidgen of justice. 

I’ve been a fan of hers since I was teen in the 80s, and her advice column in “Elle” was the highlight of the magazine for me. After looking at endless pics of perfect women with perfect skin, perfect bodies, and perfect hair, teenaged me found her column a refreshing and valuable bit of reality. She tackled little problems, like tiffs at work or what kind of gift to give a picky hostess, but she also addressed major issues like abuse and even rape. She was known for reaching out to advice-seekers privately, using her connections to help those with really serious problems access the support and resources they needed to survive. 

On top of being an excellent writer, she is known for having a wild sense of humor, a lust for adventure, and a deeply independent streak. She helped raise me, taught me how to be a strong and independent woman, how to be beautiful on the inside, both through her writing and by living her life on her own terms. 

Which is why it hit me so hard when I found out she’d been raped, and by fucking Trump no less! I could feel her sense of humiliation and powerlessness in my own bones, and it made me feel sick. 

I am beyond ecstatic that she won, that she has proven the kind of stuff she’s made of, and has once again set an excellent example for how to believe in your own strength to stand up for yourself and what is right.

""Back in 1963, American president Lyndon Johnson could sit down with a group of reporters, slap a few backs, and add, “One more thing, boys. You may see me coming in and out of a few women’s bedrooms while I am in the White House, but, just remember that is none of your business.” In 1964, he passed the Civil Rights Act, the business for which history honours him.

The ground shifted in 1987 when a group of journalists staked out the home of Gary Hart, the heavy favourite to become the Democratic nominee for president, to report on the visit of a blond bombshell named Donna Rice who happened not to be his wife. Soon Hart faced the question no one ever dared ask Johnson (or the crowded pantheon of feted presidential philanderers): “Have you ever committed adultery?” Hart said, “I do not think that is a fair question,” before ill-advisedly answering it anyway, with enough lying to tie a noose. His campaign went from meteoric to supernova within five days. He has been exiled from public life ever since.""",2023-05-09 12:30:08

First thing I thought as well,2023-05-09 12:15:47
"I was on a jury for a sexual assault case and saw something that really opened my eyes. (small potatoes, nothing like this) 

During jury selection they ask the room a bunch of questions that might disqualify them as a juror. Basically, if you're one of these then you're probably biased for or against the defendant.

* Have you ever been a victim of sexual assault or rape, documented or otherwise - some women stepped away
* Have you ever filed a restraining order against a spouse or partner - some women stepped away
* Were you sexually mistreated as a minor
* Have you ever pressed charges on a spouse or partner for sexual assault
* Have you ever resigned from a job because of unaddressed sexual misconduct 
* Have you ever left your home to avoid sexual abuse 

Some women stepped away - **Until there were almost no women left**

That was jarring. You get a bunch of randomly selected people in a room, and of all those questions, only a few women could answer no to all of them. Now, there were men who stepped away too, but not nearly as many.

That shit is so common that you can't get very many women who have never had those problems.

&nbsp;

EDIT: I should mention, since I've had a few comments ask - yes, they asked if you have committed sexual assault. Basically the inverse of all the above questions, they asked about that too. Has your spouse or partner left your home in fear of sexual misconduct, have you had a restraining order against you following sexual misconduct, etc.

And on those, a few stepped away. Not many, but a few cases where being the aggressor in a domestic incident disqualified a juror.",2023-05-09 14:03:20

Imagine trying to prove a negative. It’s impossible. Trump would have to explicitly tell his followers to attack any single person. It requires that much intent. Proving intent is insanely difficult and requires a ton of circumstantial evidence. How is a lone gunman shooting a juror, without the direct instruction or incitement from Trump to kill that person, and which instruction was provided to the gunman directly and not through happenstance, any bit of Trump’s fault? Imagine you were Trump and said some shit off hand at a private dinner, the recording got leaked, and someone kills the juror. There was no intent to actually have them killed.

*I. Do. Not. Care.* There is not one single thing you can say that will convince me a president who committed crimes should be spared from indictment and arrest. There is no ""strategy"" here. There is no chess move. Despite the distinct revulsion I feel for this specific man, there isn't even *vengence*. I don't care about the context. I don't care about anything surrounding this situation that isn't a fact of the situation itself. I don't care if this is somehow ""imbalanced"" because other criminals haven't faced consequences. If you get caught speeding, does it matter that a hundred other speeders didn't get caught? No. It doesn't. You get your ticket.

There is one thing I care about: the justice system has identified a person in power committing a crime and for once--for *once*--it isn't bending over backwards to pretend everything is OK. That is the only thing that matters. That is the only thing I care about.",2023-03-30 15:00:18

"1. Biden's big gains for his win were in the suburbs, and they weren't just a Biden vs Trump thing. They've been trending towards dems, and Trump bringing the right's extremism to the mainstream just accelerated it. They're people who want their kids to go to school and not worry about them being shot. They want easy and affordable access to healthcare. They want clean air and water. His persecution complex and screaming about death and destruction turn them off. Don't let anyone convince you these people are going to swing back to Trump because of this indictment. Those people are doomers and have no idea what they're talking about.

2. This particular case almost certainly wouldn't go to SCOTUS. State cases can go to SCOTUS, but his rights would have to be egregiously violated, and I'm sure they'll make sure they take every correct step so he has no valid reason to claim any rights violations. 

3. Even if this case or any case can get to SCOTUS, they have **literally never** sided with Trump on personal or political cases. A lot of people have just assumed they are a rubber stamp for Trump, but that has only been true for his policy cases, which usually don't actually have much to do with him and are more just general republican things. SCOTUS is not going to let Trump go free from crimes. There's no reason for them to do that, and there's nothing in their history to suggest they would do that. Doomers who claim otherwise don't know what they're talking about, again. 

4. The indictment may fire up his fans that had cooled down in time when nothing was really going on, but overall an indictment is never a good thing, and it won't be good for him politically.

5. This case is about him cheating to win the election. It is a big deal. J6 might not have even happened if he hadn't committed this crime.


Other big cases currently in the works (there are probably a lot of others): 

* Fani Willis with Georgia electoral fraud case
* Jack Smith with federal cases surrounding J6 and the classified documents, including obstruction

"This is a TRULY defining moment in American history.

No one -- MUCH LESS the President -- is above the law. NO ONE.

And I repeat myself a lot in the ""Trump indictment coming any day now"" posts, but it can't be said enough.

There has arguably never been a more important moment for American democracy, for our Constitution, for our values, for every single thing we stand for.

Donald Trump is the antithesis of everything America should stand for. He whipped up a cultish furor into fighting for everything America shouldn't be, and somehow managed to evade consequence.

Until today.

Until today.

Not to mention the standard garden-variety Republican insanity he championed and pioneered on top of that. The usual nonsense about LGBTQ people, wokeness, CRT, election fraud...

...and now it might all have been dealt the fatal blow.

It MIGHT have.

The fight is not over, by any means.

But the light at the end of the tunnel is now.

THANK YOU, NY GRAND JURY.",2023-03-30 14:49:56

>	A caveat: As a flood of commentary assessing the weight and merits of the indictment fills cable television news and social media, it is important to stress that we have not seen the charges. Nobody talking in public right now actually knows what Bragg’s theory of the case is. Assuming it’s correct that this is primarily a bookkeeping fraud case, the crucial question is what other crime does Bragg contend the falsification of Trump Organization records was meant to conceal. All the commentary about it being a campaign-finance crime relies on guesswork. That could prove correct, but may also turn out to be entirely wrong or subject to some important twist that we do not yet understand. It would be wise take all the legal analysis for now with a big grain of salt.

"I think this is the first to happen because it avoids some of the more complex legal questions the others involved. 

It’s crimes that occurred fully before he was President and are still within the statute of limitations. 

Some of the other crimes happened while he was President or shortly after he was President which raises the very tough question of where exactly the line is between actions protected by the office of the presidency and crimes that a President can be charged and convicted for. 

That’s not to say that barrier will stop those other prosecutions. It won’t. But it does slow the process down as they work through all these contingencies. You can also expect the appeals for those to be longer as the SCOTUS will inevitably have to make a decision as to what exactly a President can be charged with and under what circumstances. 

What they want to avoid is creating a precedent where a President can be charged with a crime for decisions that were made as part of carrying out the duties of the office. For example, if the President as commander in chief orders a military strike on a a terrorist and it turns out the intelligence was bad and they kill a civilian, can the President be charged with murder? Most would say they don’t want Presidents subject to charges in that kind of scenario. 

So where exactly is the line? Obviously Trump trying to overthrow the government should be a crime he’s liable for. But until the question is settled by the SCOTUS of where exactly the line is between that and protected actions the President takes, those prosecutions will drag on for a bit.",2023-03-30 14:58:30

Trump's personal attorney implicated Trump in crimes they committed together, Trump is Individual 1;^[[3]](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/07/674368228/ex-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-should-get-substantial-prison-term-feds-say)

>Pg. 11

>During the campaign, Cohen played a central role in two similar schemes to purchase the rights to stories - each from women who claimed to have had an affair with Individual-1 - so as to suppress the stories and thereby prevent them from influencing the election. With respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of payments. In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

"You can call them whatever you want, but unless we change the fundamental logic of the capitalist system, we will always have ruling oligarchs/plutocrats/kleptocrats on one side, and a brutally exploited / oppressed public on the other.

Capitalism/neoliberalism fundamentally cannot see, recognize, or actually solve this problem on any level. 

There's a reason Marxism has been so mischaracterized and repressed by our ruling oligarchs/plutocrats/kleptocrats and their peons...because he was absolutely right. 

And he was *obviously* right.  

And he was so obviously right, that anyone who actually understands what he was saying would be empowered to see, identify, and maybe actually resolve some of the fundamental problems of the capitalist system.  

Just as under slavery and feudalism, of which capitalism is an evolved form, the public has to be deliberately miseducated and kept ignorant and underdeveloped in order for the masses of people to passively tolerate capitalism/neoliberalism.  

Whatever you call our ruling oligarchs/plutocrats/kleptocrats/robber barons or their peons, they will continue robbing, enslaving, gaslighting, and socially murdering the public without recourse, because there is no mechanism under capitalism/neoliberalism to actually stop them, and they know it.

They don't want you to know it, though.  Part of the point of neoliberal politics is to give you hope that the system might work for the public and not for the oligarchs/plutocrats/kleptocrats this time.  

Lucy and the football writ large, with the exploited public as Charlie Brown.  

Meanwhile the robbery and exploitation by the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class happens in broad daylight all day every day, with zero democratic accountability, because the system evolved out of British colonialism and is fundamentally designed to allow an extractive ruling class to get away with crimes against humanity with no recourse for the public.

Some relevant excerpts:

""It is good to know some history. When Ukraine became independent after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russian leaders made clear their concerns about the prospect of former Soviet states becoming part of Nato and positioning hostile military forces along Russia’s border. US leaders recognized these concerns as legitimate at the time. They are still legitimate concerns. Invasion by Russia is not an answer; neither is intransigence by Nato. It is also important to recognize that Finland, one of the most developed and democratic countries in the world, borders Russia and has chosen not to be a member of Nato.

To put it simply, even if Russia was not ruled by a corrupt authoritarian leader like Vladimir Putin, Russia, like the United States, would still have an interest in the security policies of its neighbors. Does anyone really believe that the United States would not have something to say if, for example, Mexico was to form a military alliance with a US adversary?

Countries should be free to make their own foreign policy choices, but making those choices wisely requires a serious consideration of the costs and benefits. The fact is that the US and Ukraine entering into a deeper security relationship is likely to have some very serious costs – for both countries.""

">When has the government ever kept things in check?

Since the Constitution, which was created to put a check on *democracy* since it was allowed to actually reign under the Articles of Confederation after the revolution.

>All communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and well born, the other *the mass of the people*. The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and however generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true in fact. The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give therefore to the first class a distinct, **permanent share in the government**. They will check the unsteadiness of the second, and as they cannot receive any advantage by a change, they therefore will ever maintain good government. Can a democratic assembly, who annually revolve in the mass of the people, be supposed steadily to pursue the public good? Nothing but a permanent body can check **the imprudence of democracy**. Their turbulent and uncontrouling disposition requires checks. - Alexander Hamilton, Constitutional Convention, Monday, June 19th, 1787

For James Madison, that check on democracy was the Senate:

>The man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on his sofa or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge of the wants or feelings of the day laborer. The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe; when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of the landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect **the minority of the opulent** against the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability. Various have been the propositions; but my opinion is, the longer they continue in office, the better will these views be answered. - James Madison, Tuesday, June 26th, 1787.

The US was *designed* to be a plutocracy/oligarchy with just enough appearances and veneer of democracy to convince the masses. And here we are.

"That's exactly right.  It's common for the rich and powerful to delude themselves into thinking they can control fascistic populist leaders.  These leaders are typically narcissistic, very affected by flattery and often not the brightest bulbs around.  Like you say, early on the populist is dependent upon other power brokers to secure his own position, and so offers some deference and promises.

But the paranoid narcissist leader quickly becomes very jealous and fearful of any other power centers in society once he has established himself.  He demands a bent knee and pledge that his patrons work only to further his power and glory.  The wealthy soon find that their influence is only that of a minor consultant, and even then only if they indulge the leader's ego and whims.  Their ability to run their company as they see fit, worrying only about taxes and regulatory agencies that they can manipulate, is replaced with demands that they put the leader's interests first.  They're allowed access to wealth and privilege, but their visibility and wealth make them conspicuous  targets if they step out of line.

They know more about these things than us. The first bunch of states aren’t friendly to moderates, they felt the votes going forward would go toward Biden if they dropped. Name familiarity maybe?

"From column:

Never in recent history, perhaps, have so many Americans viewed the Supreme Court as fundamentally partisan.

Public approval of the nine-justice panel stands near historic lows. Declining faith in the institution seems rooted in a growing concern that the high court is deciding cases on politics, rather than law. In one recent poll, a majority of Americans opined that Supreme Court justices let partisan views influence major rulings.  

Three quarters of Republicans approve of the high court’s recent job performance. But Democrats’ support has plummeted to 13 percent, and more than half the nation overall disapproves of how the court is doing its job. 

Public support for the high court sank swiftly last summer in response to Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a landmark ruling that revoked a constitutional right to abortion. The decision delighted many conservatives but defied a large majority of Americans who believe abortion should be legal.  

Yet, partisan anger runs deeper than Dobbs. Liberals are fuming about a confluence of lucky timing and political maneuvering that enabled a Republican-controlled Senate to approve three conservative justices in four years, knocking the panel out of synch with the American public.",2023-01-11 03:57:05

A previous comment here to expand on this:  

Two very obviously telling stats I always resort to are as follows:  

- Republicans haven't won the popular vote to become president since 1988; 34 years ago, and he was a one-term president  

- The current Supreme Court is a reflection of how unrepresentative and unfair the rule of law and federal government overall is:  

 - 6 of the 9 Supreme Court seats are filled by conservative-appointed justices.  

 - 5 of those 6 justices were appointed by presidents who *lost* the popular vote to become president.  

 - 3 of those 5 justices were appointed by a president who not only lost the popular vote, but was impeached twice and has been documented by multiple investigative authorities as being helped into office by way of Russian efforts.  

 - 1 of the 6 willfully accepted his appointment into a vacancy intentionally held open by the Republican Senate majority leader who blocked the opposing party's 1st and only presidential nomination, citing an upcoming election ""to let the people decide"", which was 237 days out.  

 - the 6th conservative justice was nominated 35 days before the 2020 election, the shortest period of time between nomination and the next presidential election in US history.  She was confirmed only 8 days before the election.  She also willfully accepted her nomination by an already impeached president who went on to become a twice-impeached president following her appointment that took place before the election he lost.  

 - The only 1 of the 6 conservative appointed justices who *was* appointed by a Republican president who won the popular vote was credibly accused of sexual misconduct before being confirmed, and he is not the only one of the 6 to be.  He is also currently under scrutiny for his wife's role in an insurrection and his own dissent on a case involving her role.  

 - All 6 are members of The Federalist Society, a conservative organization known to have [associations with dark money](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/the-scheme-speech-5-the-federalist-society) and vast influence in conservative politics.  

- An unprecedented leak that still goes unresolved preceded the overturning of Roe v Wade, removing major rights from Americans for the first time in roughly 50 years, and going against several of the prospective justices' positions during confirmation hearings.  

The [Senate is undemocratic](https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2070&context=concomm) - it's the most powerful body of government and does not represent the people fairly, or at all.

"That's why relying on precedent is so important. And why perhaps the worst thing this court has done is to completely disregard precedent. Yes, some rulings are bad and should be overturned. But when you completely disregard precedent it turns the court into basically the new legislative branch who can change any and every law they see fit on a whim. It's also why their decisions to overlook lack of standing and their pattern of ruling far beyond the scope of their cases is such a problem. Those two things as well in the past helped to keep the Supreme Court from being as powerful as it is today. Unfortunately standing, precedent, and scope were just things that court respected with nothing actually binding the court to respect them.",2023-01-11 06:32:11

We could turn the judiciary into its own, unelected aristocracy, have judges choose their successors without any input from Congress or POTUS or the public. But that just means biases are perpetuated and the judiciary never evolves with the public. 

We could ask for direct election of judges. But that would only intensify the party politics as the two major parties would back their preferred candidates and flood us all with terrible ads, just like we see in many states that elect their judges. 

We could require judges to receive unanimous support from the Senate (and/or the House) to ensure bipartisan compromise. But the last decade or so has shown us that Republicans would rather leave seats open indefinitely than compromise with Democrats on an appointment.

""But if Supreme Court justices are intended to be above the political fray and carry a noble air of inaccessibility, the historical society offered partisan activists such as Wright, Monaghan, and Crow an inroad at a surprisingly affordable price. Less than $10,000, two recent trustees said, could ultimately earn a donor a spot on the board.   
  
Wright, Monaghan, and **Crow** have had ideological interests in the decisions of the court. They shared a history of conservative activism **and have been major donors to right-wing Christian causes.** In many instances, they have called for the Supreme Court justices to take an expansive view of religious liberties that would limit abortion access and enshrine Christian values in government.   
  
Monaghan, the octogenarian pizza magnate, has founded a slew of right-wing nonprofits dedicated to ending legal abortion. One of the groups he founded, the Thomas More Law Center, **has filed dozens of amicus briefs on cases pertaining to abortion access, the separation of church and state, and marriage equality** — including at least four while Monaghan served as a trustee between 2007 and 2013.""",2023-04-06 05:23:55

">For more than two decades, Thomas has accepted luxury trips virtually every year from the Dallas businessman without disclosing them, documents and interviews show. A public servant who has a salary of $285,000, he has vacationed on Crow’s superyacht around the globe. He flies on Crow’s Bombardier Global 5000 jet. He has gone with Crow to the Bohemian Grove, the exclusive California all-male retreat, and to Crow’s sprawling ranch in East Texas. And Thomas typically spends about a week every summer at Crow’s private resort in the Adirondacks.

He thinks he is above the law. Since he has never disclosed these gifts.

Here is a playlist of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse's epic 17-part presentation on the Republican Dark Money scheme to capture our Supreme Court:

[""The Scheme""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAplGu1RxPg&list=PLhyg5hj7I21i1Aqcaym9TRFrpWjPN9_ms)

Some quotes with context from the [Powell Memo](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/the-scheme-1-the-powell-memo#:~:text=%E2%80%9CStrength%20lies%20in%20organization%2C%20in,united%20action%20and%20national%20organizations.%E2%80%9D), which is basically the founding document of the radical pro-corporate, pro-wealthy overhaul of our economic system that we have experienced since it was released in the 1970s:

>“Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.”

...

>“National television networks should be monitored in the same way that textbooks should be kept under constant surveillance,” he said. Corporate America should aggressively insist on the right to be heard, on “equal time,” and corporate America should be ready to deploy, and I am quoting him here, “whatever degree of pressure — publicly and privately — may be necessary.” This would be “a long road,” Powell warned, “and not for the fainthearted.”

...

>“Political power,” Powell wrote, “is necessary; … [it] must be assiduously cultivated; and … when necessary … must be used aggressively and with determination.” He concluded that “it is essential [to] be far more aggressive than in the past,” with “no hesitation to attack,” “not the slightest hesitation to press vigorously in all political arenas,” and no “reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose” the corporate effort. In a nutshell, no holds barred.

I don't even think we have to win, I think 'we the people' have to organize enough in non-profits that LOBBY at least enough to 'call' the asshole motherfuckers bets.  They offer 50k, okay, we offer 60k.  They offer 70k, okay.... ad infinitum.

I don't think they CAN pay the rates that we think our politicians' ethics should cost, they want to pay pennies.  I think we can outbid them or force them to not have the execs making as much as they 'want'...  And they'll flip the board over.

"Of note, the Citizens United decision actually said that disclosure regulations were not only still allowed but were necessary.

>Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they “impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,” and “do not prevent anyone from speaking.” The Court has subjected these requirements to “exacting scrutiny,” which requires a “substantial relation” between the disclosure requirement and a “sufficiently important” governmental interest.

>In Buckley , the Court explained that disclosure could be justified based on a governmental interest in “provid[ing] the electorate with information” about the sources of election-related spending. The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to BCRA §§201 and 311. There was evidence in the record that independent groups were running election-related advertisements “ ‘while hiding behind dubious and misleading names.’ ” The Court therefore upheld BCRA §§201 and 311 on the ground that they would help citizens “ ‘make informed choices in the political marketplace.’ ”

>...With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their corporation’s political speech advances the corporation’s interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are “ ‘in the pocket’ of so-called moneyed interests.” The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.

The fact that the rules are either weak or rarely enforced is the fault of the legislative and/or executive branches, not the CU decision.

"I would like to coin a new phrase based on the behavior of my least favorite supreme court justice: Clarence Thomas.

* If you argue in bad faith more than you engage in good faith
* If you lie again and again about your intentions and the meaning of your actions
* If you are a blatant hypocrite
* If you have no shame about your behavior

Then you are: a Clarence Thomas

  
Examples:  


* Lindsay Graham - he's a real Clarence Thomas. A man who was anti-Trump up until the point it became politically expedient to support him.
* Susan Collins - has been a Clarence Thomas for years. Claims to be a moderate but consistently votes with conservatives in this country.
* Mitch McConnell - may be the biggest Clarence Thomas there is
* Ginny Thomas - a treasonous Clarence Thomas
* When Newt Gingrich was impeaching Bill Clinton for lying about getting a blowjob while Newt was cheating on his wife, he was being a Clarence Thomas.
* When John Edwards was campaigning for President and presented himself as a model citizen and exemplary person while cheating on his wife who was suffering from cancer, he was being a Clarence Thomas
* When Boris Johnson was preaching to the UK about staying in lockdowns and emphasizing the importance of adhering to the rules while he was partying in Downing Street, he was being a Clarence Thomas
* When John Lennon was talking about peace and love and then abusing his wife and child, he was being a Clarence Thomas
* When Andrew Cuomo was talking about justice for women in the MeToo movement but had sexually harassed people himself, he was being a huge Clarence Thomas",2023-04-13 15:08:27

We had annual trainings to review this AND had to log any investments we had that were not passive investments like in a mutual fund. I understand almost all government employees have similar restrictions and trainings yet a JUSTICE of the United States Supreme Court, who is seeing the most consequential cases our government has somehow is not held to an equal or even more stringent standard. If I did something unethical like insider trading the impact would be peanuts in comparison to this hack— so it blows my mind this guy somehow thought it’d be all above board having this many clearly unethical relationships with a billionaire.

Then, Crow put $36,000 into the house. Presumably, that’s money that Thomas and his brother didn’t have to spend fixing up the place for mom. That’s also money going directly into Thomas’s pocket that wasn’t reported.

On top of that, what are the odds that mom is living there rent free, which probably gets Clarence off the hook for rent.  Again, money directly into Thomas’s pocket.

It’s pretty ironic that Crow wants to turn Clarance’s boyhood home into a Clarance Thomas museum - essentially, a monument to Clarence’s corruption. Because make no mistake - there’s no way this cute little arrangement didn’t benefit Thomas directly.",2023-04-13 22:16:53

Thomas' whole childhood is just like, constant exposures to the worst of humanity from every direction, with no light at the end of the tunnel. IIRC at some point prior to living with the grandparents, he also lived with an aunt but then he and his brother accidentally burnt her house down or something.

"The tip of an Iceberg is about 10% of its mass so that is probably a gross over estimation in this case. I guarantee we are seeing way less than 10% of the bribery.  What we are seeing is only the stuff they were too lazy to do in the proper ways. 

I used to work in investment banking, GS, Lehman and more senior roles at 2nd tier banks. ( I have no excuse and now I'm doing something better to try to make up for my time on the dark side)

Here's just one way that banks facilitate the bribing of politicians in a 'technically legal' and virtually untraceable way.... 

Company X wants to buy Politician A

X creates a special convertible note that has a super favourable conversion rate to X's shares on default. 

Bank tells A about this 'great deal' and A buys it all.   Usually the bank extends credit to A so they don't even have to front any cash. 

X then deliberately defaults on the coupon, so A gets the right to convert the debt to equity at a discount but this usually never happens.

Bank either takes the equity and pays A the difference in value between the conversion rate and market, so A makes money for doing absolutely nothing. (well actually it's not for nothing but for doing whatever they were being bribed to do.) 

X can hide this as a cost of minor financing so even highly scrutinised public companies can do it. 

Note nothing here is really illegal except the insider trading and personal conversations to set it all up and they are done so they can never be discovered. Most importantly all the artifacts of the deal can be buried or hidden so there is no way anyone would uncover any connection between A and X. 

You can move millions of dollars in one deal and there are countless similar variations of achieving the same thing. 

If A's windfall is onshore it just looks like shrewd trading, but more often it is all kept offshore.

The value of bribes that happen in this manner is beyond comprehension for any normal person its impossible to quantify as its so well hidden but it easily could be in the order of many billions per year.

This is why most politicians (almost all GOP and most Dem and probably most judges ) are not doing their actual job, - working for the people - there is just way too much to be earned by serving those with money.",2023-04-13 16:11:36

"He’s made some crappy comments about his sister in the past. 

>	Most pointedly, there is Emma Mae Martin, Judge Thomas's sister, who was the subject of some of the most exasperated statements he was quoted as making at a conference of black conservatives in 1980: ""She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check. That is how dependent she is. What's worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check, too.”

>	In an interview in her weather-battered yellow frame house in Pin Point, Mrs. Martin said that she had been forced onto welfare periodically after her husband abandoned her and her small children and she became too sick to work. But, she said, she had only remained on the program once for a sustained period. This was between 1977 and 1981, when an aunt asked her to care for her when she became sick. She said the aunt had taken in her family, including Clarence, in the early 50's after their house burned down.

>	""It was one of the things I promised her because she didn't want to live in a nursing home,"" Mrs. Martin said.

>	When the aunt died, Mrs. Martin inherited her house in Pin Point and, rather than become dependent on welfare, returned to work. She now is a cook at Candler General Hospital, which had been for whites only until the early 60's.

>	Notwithstanding the seeming harshness of his quotes about her welfare involvement, Mrs. Martin said she and her brother are close. ""He understood why I had to be on it,"" she said.

""Disney regrets that it has come to this,"" the complaint continued. ""But having exhausted efforts to seek a resolution, the Company is left with no choice but to file this lawsuit to protect its cast members, guests, and local development partners from a relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint unpopular with certain State officials.""

""A company has a right to freedom of speech just like individuals do,"" Iger said at the time, describing DeSantis' policies as ""anti-business"" and ""anti-Florida.""

""Disney finds itself in this regrettable position because it expressed a viewpoint the Governor and his allies did not like,"" Wednesday's complaint reads.

""Disney wishes that things could have been resolved a different way. But Disney also knows that it is fortunate to have the resources to take a stand against the State’s retaliation—a stand smaller businesses and individuals might not be able to take when the State comes after them for expressing their own views. In America, the government cannot punish you for speaking your mind.""

Anybody that wants to continue to enjoy their 1A rights and not further relegate the Constitution to toilet paper *should* be rooting for Disney like a sports team in this specific instance.

>Story time: I got ""tricked into going to a Drag bar(?) & I've never really known where or how to share this story but I'm gonna leave it here,

>A few years ago, when I had just started getting into doing stand-up. I was traveling 60-70 minutes a night just to go up at 2-4 open mics a week while running around the city. One night a few years ago, before Covid. I was talking to a couple of other comedians from the city. About how I was wasting like $40 just in gas just to do open mics at bars im buying drinks at to go up. I'm from Maine and the comedy scene just wasn't great at the time for unexperienced comedians like myself.

>The two of em' mentioned they actually knew a club that was super popular and did open mics once a week near me. I was so excited. That night I went & saved it my GPS. I then went up to the bar to do a set that week.

>What they failed to tell me, is that not only is this not a comedy bar. It's a **Drag show bar**. One for gay/trans(?) men & women to come & express themselves freely. The open mic? Was for the drag shows and other people to perform.

>Now. To be fair. I should have clocked something when I saw the line of incredibly handsome women lined out the door.. but this is Maine, & I own a mirror. So who am I to judge? /s 

>The second I walked in though. I could tell someone had played a 'prank' on me. This was no comedy club.

>I was actually gonna leave. I felt a bit shocked. I'm from a small town, and I had never been in that type of environment before. It felt like I didn't belong. I must of had *that* look on my face too. Cuz as I went to leave, this incredibly kind wo(man)(?)(I don't know the correct vocabulary, I'm sorry) came up to me. Making a harmless comment about this being my ""first time"" then invited me to have a drink with them at the bar.

>I tried to explain to them that I thought this was a comedy club. That a couple guys from Boston had ""tricked"" me into coming to this drag bar. As a straight guy I didn't think I belonged at a club like this. Not because I thought it was like, gross. Just that I felt like this was a safe space for the LGBTQIA+ community. And i'm not one of the vowels. I'm an S.

>They looked me confused, a bit sad. Saying essentially ""That's exactly the attitude we don't allow here"". I was scared. I thought I was about to get my first #MeToo.. But what she actually meant is that if I want to have a good time, then stay, & have a good time. No one there was gonna judge me because of my gender, race, sexuality, etc.

>And you know what? They were right. I stayed. & I'm **so. damn. happy.** I did. I had a few drinks. I danced a little (I never do that). I even got hit on for the first time at bar in my life (that never happens).

>Everyone there was so inclusive. They wanted everyone to have fun. It was like outside of the club they faced persecution & bigotry. But inside they felt free & safe. This is something I had never experienced in my life. It didn't magically *turn me gay*. They didn't 'slip me the magic fairy potion'. But being in this environment did make me happier. It's one of the most joyous nights of my life.

>This is what Republicans, MAGA, & people like this shooter want to take away. This happiness. This sense of belonging. To feel safe in their own space. Selfishly now that I've experienced it. How could I ever allow or be comfortable seeing it ripped away from others?

>Thanks to whoever read this!! I don't really know why I'm sharing this story, & I'm sorry if the details are a bit muddy I wrote this out just now. I'm also sorry if it's the wrong kinda story share or if I'm wrong.

"As someone who's been watching Disney's moves since they acquired Lucasfilm, it's real.

Or maybe it's not, but they're committed to being fake about it.  That's not to say that they haven't made some bad decisions, but even just looking at the Disney+ homepage shows you how many resources they're putting into showcasing diverse talent and stories.  ""they only cast John Boyega for diversity!""  ""They only cast Oscar Isaac for diversity!""  ""they only cast Diego Luna for diversity!""  ""they only cast Kelly Marie Tran for diversity!""  ""They only cast Pedro Pascal for diversity!""  ""They only cast Giancarlo Esposito for diversity!""  ""They only cast Michelle Ang for diversity!""  ""They only cast Temeura Morrison for diversity!""  ""They only cast Ming-Na Wen for diversity!""  ""They only cast Debra Wilson for diversity!""  ""They only cast Elizabeth Grullón for diversity!""  ""They only cast Moses Ingram for diversity!""  ""They only cast Janina Gavankar for diversity!""  ""They only cast Rosario Dawson for diversity!""  ""They only cast Grogu for diversity!""  ""They only cast Natasha Liu Bordizzo for diversity!""  ""They only cast Eman Esfandi for diversity!""

Like, at some point you've got to realize it's an intentional effort to be more inclusive, not just a single token character.

And at the end of the day, if they're only pretending to care because it gives them money, but it means they keep up the charade, does it really matter?  If I'm being nice to my little brother because my mom is paying me to, does my little brother not benefit from that?",2023-03-22 10:56:55

"I had a slightly similar experience.  We were stuck in south London waiting for a train to take us to somewhere and had an hour to kill and found, what I know realise, is a very famous gay pub\\bar\\club called the Royal Vauxhall Tavern.  There was about 8 of us and the guy on the door did ask if we knew it was a gay place and if we were ok with that.  We said yes and popped in for a quick pint.  Aside from being absolutely fabulous they do drag nights and all sorts of other stuff so the inside was covered in pics of queens and it was filled with plenty of obviously gay men.  My old mate ""shouty"" Nathan was at the back when we entered and hadn't realised it was a gay club and you could see his mind working as he looked round the room.  He then announced in his incredibly loud voice

""Fuck me lads, this is a gay bar!""

It was like the scene in the western when the piano player stops playing.  Everyone stopped talking and all looked around at us with suspicion and the place went deathly quiet.  Momentarily I thought we were going to get trounced - there were some big old bears there who looked like they fancied a rumble.  Of course nothing of the sort happened - someone started laughing and then suddenly we were like everyone's best mates. We had more than one drink, talked to the locals, missed our train and had a lovely couple of hours being entertained by people that, as you say, MAGA wants to silence or worse.  Luckily London and the UK are still very open places for the most part but there is a creeping anti drag\\trans\\gay rhetoric that is gaining ground.",2023-03-22 06:38:51

There are already laws that protect people from real crimes like rape (not that women have had much luck prosecuting men, but laws already exist.).  I have never felt uncomfortable around someone expressing themselves or who doesn’t match some social or gender norm.

"I had same experience just as a rave/club DJ back in the late 90's.. I was traveling from Galveston to Houston every weekend to play techno / trance clubs and make like 200 bucks a night but spending a ton in gas money and my car was always needing repair because it was a POS. 

A DJ buddy of mine knew I needed some gigs more local so he gave me the contact to a club that I had not heard of before and got booked for an early set since first time and owner didn't know if I was any good. 

I showed up and immediately same thing happened. I felt out of place as a straight male (no bigotry here just not something I was used to seeing men dressed in drag and a lot of flamboyant muscle shirtless guys in cowboy hats walking around) and knew my normal techno records would be too hard for this place and crowd. I almost left and ended up talking to the bartender that I didn't think I could stay and perform a set and he did the same as basically saying have a drink with us and relax and no judgement. 

I was so glad I did decide to stay and had one of the best DJ sets and experiences ever! it was a blast and the crowd was so happy and everyone was on the floor dancing with no reservations. I ended up using the clubs house records and a mix of what I had and it worked!

that night changed everything about how I felt about the LGBTQ community and my support for them is immense and all love to them. 

I actually got hit on as well and it was not as weird as I thought it would be and that person that hit on me ended up becoming a friend and I still keep in touch with him and he sometimes comes up to Dallas to visit us.",2023-03-22 07:40:40
"Edit: typos. 

Years ago I wound up being the janitor for a bath house - a private hotel just for gay men. I wound up being the manager in the end, hosting parties and raves for the clients. 

These guys ranged from guys who were flamboyant, farmer guys you wouldn’t tell apart from other farm hands, ugly guys and guys so refined I wanted to update my wardrobe to look that good. 

After years I never once thought “oh no I’m going to get the gay.” Sure people hit on me, and it was flattering but didn’t “turn me gay.” Some guys didn’t let up and sometimes it took a more “Dude, I know I’m not but I just don’t swing that way. Sorry to hurt your feelings.”

If anything, it made me start to realize what people who fear gay people fear. It’s not that they’ll “catch the gay.” It’s worth that they’ll be treated the way they treat women. 

If they don’t listen when a woman tells them no when being hit on, or demeans them as just a sexual object - when they get hit on by a gay man who keeps pushing they suddenly feel how a woman they’ve done that too feels. And you know what? It’s not cool. It’s not cool when a girl does it to a guy or another girl, or when a guy doesn’t take no from a girl or another guy. 

*That* is what they really fear: that their consent will be ignored. And rather than change and be better people and respect other’s desires, they jump right to “they want to invade our bathrooms and make us all gay!” 

Because if male homophobes had their way, they’d be able to go on treating women like dirt and control their bodies. But heaven forbid they get treated the same.",2023-03-22 09:55:50

"I went to a gay bar with a group of friends as part of a going away get-together about 15 years ago. So this was just a few years after Virginia passed a constitutional amendment against gay marriage, just to give you an idea of the attitude of the time. 

So the fried is a lesbian that was moving, and just wanted to go to the bar one last time before she moved and invited us out with her. 

I was open to the idea of going to a gay bar but most of the guys in the group were uncomfortable. They got in there, found pool tables in the back, and a bunch of straight guys essentially huddled back there. I followed her around for a bit and eventually sat down at the bar. A guy in chaps and a leather cowboy outfit sat down next to me, flirted, and tried to buy me drinks. I told him I was straight but didn't mind talking/drinking with him. So he and I sat there, bullshitted and drank for about 15 minutes. Then the drag show started. 

Those drag queens were funny as hell. I watched the show, laughed and had fun. Afterwards the hostess drag queen walked around and was talking to everybody around the stage. The cowboy told her I was straight, and she sat down and talked with us for a few minutes before moving on, asked me to come back for the next show.

I've never had so much fun at a bar in my life. I had random guys buying drinks for me. I watched a drag show and talked to drag queens. I was out there having a blast, and my friends in the back just played pool all night. They missed out.",2023-03-22 08:46:54
"I’ve been to several gay bars and drag bars with my gay friends and clients and as a straight (S) person I have to agree, very fun.

The last time I went to a gay bar was right after I broke up with my Ex of 7 years.  I met a girl there I’d been interested in for a while, my clients kept telling me it was a good bar but failed to mention it was a gay bar.  A guy sat at the table with us and we all became friends.

He’s literally the reason I got laid that night. Went out a few more times with him and his friends and almost got SHOT trying to help someone getting jumped in an ally (another story for another time), and ended up at the owner of a gay bars mansion condo in the middle of Phoenix.

I grew up in a fundamentalist religious cult that said called the existence of the LGBTQ+ community was judgment of God. Luckily i had access to internet so i was able to see through a lot of their BS - sadly it did make me homophobic for a while until one of my best friends came out to me. I realized then it did not fucking matter.   


Fast forward a few years (went to therapy). Matured. And went to an LGBTQ+ bar and I never felt so much acceptance from others. Obviously my abuse/trauma was different from their's but fuck man... in my experience its my favorite community to party with now. Several of my best friends are from that community.

When I was a young teenager in the 80's, there was an all-ages LBGTQ+ club a couple of miles from my house. By the time I was 12 I was sneaking out of my bedroom window to go down there. I met and made friends with so many people from teens to adults, including teen boys who were already cross-dressing. Butch lesbians, drag queens, normal gay people, normal straight people... it was just a place where everyone could go and just be themselves without judgment. My single mom was a binge alcoholic and there were weeks at a time when she was just too drunk to really care for us; Phases gave me a safe place to go where people cared about me and I didn't have to think about my home life for a while.

"I had the same feeling at a Lady Gaga concert. 

I repressed my gender fluidity for a long time and it took me until pandemic reflection to really unlock it and pinpoint what had caused me so much inner turmoil my whole life. 

My girlfriend loved Gaga and took me to her show around 2015 and I wasn’t totally uncomfortable but I felt a little out of place since I hadn’t loosened up at that point in my life. I was still fairly EDM bro with my fashion style, never worn make up before etc. 

But what I did notice was that everyone there was decked out to the 9s and I could tell it was a safe space for anyone who feels like they’re a little different. Mid way through her set I was in tears. I’d never been in a room so MASSIVE that felt like such an inclusive space. I’d only been to mega churches with that many people so united in what was happening, but even as a Christian I hated church. 

It really is something special to be in such an open minded place where people feel safe and accepted. 

I think many of us are abused in some way as kids, whether it’s by family, bullies at school, religion etc. and there are two paths we can take: either “I was abused and therefore nobody deserves a safe space” or “I was abused and I want to do my best to make sure nobody else has to feel that way.”",2023-03-22 11:21:34

As soon as my dad started hearing Spanish words coming over the PA he fucking lost it and in this shrill tone of voice makes some kind of shitty comment like *""why do they have to do this bullshit""* and I thought appealing to his capitalist sensibilities would do the trick.

Now it should be noted Title VII covers issues such as hiring practices. Stripping anyone, protected class or not, of constitutional rights is a different issue but all must pass some form of the rational basis test. Therein, the government must to a varying degree prove the necessity for implanting restrictions. Each specific right (such as voting) has its own court precedent history to go off of to determine when the necessary test requirements are passed.

“Oh… I’m sorry, I just can’t look at you the same way knowing you’ve been with a (man/woman).”

“You’re attracted to both?? Doesn’t that make you twice as likely to cheat??? No thanks.”

If something Disney puts out makes you really angry, you should know this doesn’t surprise them. You’re merely part of the small minority of fans they don’t mind losing. It may be controversial in your particular trailer park, but on a national level the matter was settled 5+ years ago.",2023-03-22 11:04:06

A lot of it I think stems from confusion over different kinds of attraction, as well as an inability or unwillingness to understand that some people just don’t feel something so central to a lot of people.

As someone whose lived on the political left my entire life, I've never seen the level of in-fighting I see between LGBT activist types and allies who are just trying to help.

"This is similar to conservatives’ opinions on ESG investment funds. 

The backlash against them started because some independent Texas drillers were refused loans by large investment banks because the banks determined that, long-term, fossil fuels were a bad investment and they had concerns whether the loans would get repaid. As it happens, those same investment banks had ESG investment funds. The oilmen, and then the TX legislature, and then various other red state legislatures, complained that the banks were “discriminating” (their word) against the fossil fuel industry at the behest of the liberal green agenda, and that it was bad corporate investor policy, because ESG funds, while they might make the investors feel good, we’re comparative money losers. 

Turns out that, in the (so far, like 10 - 15 years) ESG funds do better than traditional index funds, much better than funds that include / lean heavily into fossil fuel investment.

"Really sorry to hear that. It can be very frustrating to be misunderstood so thoroughly. Personally I’ve struggled with it even just internally, trying to figure out where I might fit in, if anywhere at all.

If you’re interested, I’ll write my pseudo-“coming out”, though the tl;dr is basically: it’s not so important that others understand it, as much as it is that they accept you for who you are.

So my overly long and unnecessary story:

At some point in high school, I felt kinda like an outcast for having never been in a relationship. A relationship, sex, they weren’t things I super wanted, but I felt like I needed. Like they were normal. I blamed it on being shy and hyper introverted, and moved on.

College comes. A few years in, I’ve come out of my shell. I have incredible friends, I go out all the time. I’m happy. But at some point I say hey wait! I’m still not doing the sex. Everything’s changed except that. That’s when the idea of asexuality enters my mind.

I drunkenly tell a friend—a great guy, but he’s born and raised conservative, so I shouldn’t have expected him to get it—that I think I’m asexual. He asks if I think some people are attractive and I say yeah. I do. So he says I’m not asexual. And I can’t argue with him there, but I disagree because it doesn’t feel right.

So I spend a long, LONG time looking at all of this: smaller identities that fall under the ace umbrella, types of attraction, sex-favorability within asexuality. I adopt and drop labels over the course of a couple years, not really feeling like any of them gives a proper name. All the while, I feel kind of lost. Frustrated at a missing identity, it feels.

At some point, some friends are discussing preferences in partners. It comes to me and I just kinda shrug. 

“What do you mean, shrug?”

And I, drunkenly again (noticing a trend as I write this), say I think I’m kinda asexual.

And then over the course of the next like twenty minutes my gay and bi friends are just repeatedly saying “welcome to the community!” and “A is one of the letters!” and making me feel loved.

To this day it’s kind of an inside joke to them and I to refer to me as being “in the community” (the identity I’ve become comfortable with now is something I’d call ace-adjacent. grey-asexual)

But what mattered is I knew they’d be accepting of me no matter what. I know they don’t fully understand it—when we go out partying they’ll still try to set me up, but I’ll just say “community” and they get it—but that’s okay. Once I knew I was accepted, I no longer really felt so lost within my own identity, and felt closer to my friends than I had before.

Reading this all back, there was definitely no reason to type it all out and idk if it’s even relevant, but I already have so I’m not gonna delete it. Maybe just that it’s worth the risk to come out, even if you don’t think they’d get it",2023-03-22 11:11:55

"I'm bi. I have heard definitions of pansexuality versus bisexuality like that quite a bit, but personally I'm not keen on them (and I know many of my bi friends aren't either) because it reminds me of various bisexual stereotypes, like that we're hypersexual. I define bisexual as being attracted to your own gender and at least one other gender. Nothing about how you feel that attraction, just about what genders you're attracted to, just like how the definitions of straight and gay work. 

So with that definition, bisexual can be used as an umbrella term covering for a number of other identities, including pansexual. And in fact all the bi people I know are attracted to all genders, we just picked bi as a label instead of pan. 

But I definitely know that there's pansexual people who don't want to be called bi. That makes sense to me in terms of respecting someone's self-identification, but I have gotten the impression that some pan people chose to identify as pan rather than bi because they have negative associations with the word bisexual or are mistaken about the definition of bisexual. Like I've heard people say that pan people are attracted to trans people and bi people aren't, which not only isn't true, it implies bisexuality is inherently transphobic.",2023-03-22 23:20:31

1. Biden and Pence fully cooperated. They invited the FBI to search their properties. They turned over documents as they were found. There is no evidence that they ever tried to lie, mislead, or obstruct the FBI.",2023-06-08 16:57:01

"Special Counsel Jack Smith's classified documents investigation into former president Trump has lead to the federal indictment of a president for the first time in American history. So how did we get here?

Below are the sequence of events in chronological order following the lawful search warrant to recover classified materials from Mar-A-Lago. The Department of Justice is investigating Trump for mishandling hundreds of classified documents.

1. Federal Judge Reinhart - A federal magistrate judge in South Florida who signed off on the Mar-a-Lago search warrant as the Justice Department investigates Trump mishandling classified documents.^[[1]](https://globalnews.ca/news/9048549/fbi-obtain-search-warrant-trump-mar-a-lago/)

2. District Judge Cannon - A lower court judge appointed by Trump. Trump's lawyers used her to delay the Department of Justice investigation of Trump mishandling classified documents. She made very questionable decisions including ordering a stay (stop) on the investigation and appointing a special master to review all the documents.^[[2]](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/20/how-judge-aileen-cannon-broke-with-conservatives-00057647)

3. Special Master Judge Dearie - A Reagan appointed  judge from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He also served as a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) from 2012 to 2019. Judge Dearie is known as a very fair judge and is historically respected by both Republicans and Democrats. Trump's team and the DoJ provided Judge Cannon with a shortlist of judges to be the Special Master, however they  only agreed on Judge Dearie.^[[3]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62893028) Judge Dearie questioned the authority of District Court Judge Cannon and demanded to see evidence of Trump's outlandish allegations such as the FBI  planting evidence.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/special-master-trump-privilege.html)

4. 11^th Circuit Court of Appeals - Has jurisdiction over Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. A panel of 3 judges, including 2 Trump appointees, ruled in favour of the Justice Department and forced the lower court of Judge Cannon to reverse her decision on stopping/staying the investigation. The 11^th Circuit stayed portions of Judge Cannon's rulings, paving the way for the Justice Department to continue their investigation into Trump mishandling classified documents.^[[5]](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-grants-dojs-request-partial-stay-judges/story?id=90296433) Furthermore, the 11^th Circuit ordered the end of the Special Master review of the documents, removing a hurdle that hindered the Justice Department's criminal investigation of Trump.^[[6]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/federal-appeals-court-halts-special-master-review-of-trumps-mar-a-lago-documents) The judicial decision handed down by the Appeals Court, pay particular attention to pages 20 and 21. The 11^th Circuit said that District Judge Cannon was completely wrong and that no one, including a former President, is above the law.^[[7]](https://lawandcrime.com/trump/the-answer-is-no-conservative-11th-circuit-panel-including-two-judges-trump-appointed-puts-a-stop-to-special-masters-mar-a-lago-review/)

5. Following the ruling by the conservative leaning Federal Appeals Court, Trump appointed District Court Judge Cannon ended the special master review, paving the way for the investigation into the former president mishandling highly classified documents to continue.^[[8]](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/trump-special-master-case.html)

January 13th, 2021: Trump is impeached--for a SECOND time--for inciting violence on Jan. 6th. It's worth noting that the insurrection took place only tweeks before Biden's administration took over and it only took Congress a week to vote 

Mau 9th, 2023: Jury finds Trump guilty of sexually assaulting EJ Carroll and defaming his character. Let's not forget that the infamous Access Hollywood video was played during his deposition and he, pretty much, doubles down on the notion that rich and famous people should be able to freely commit sexual assault. 

June 8th, 2023: Federal Prosecutors have indicted Trump for the misappropriation -IE: Theft- of classified Federal documents.

Trump was not indicted by Biden. Not by Jack Smith or AG Garland. He was indicted by 23 American citizens. They voted to hold our rulers to the same standard as we are held. There is nothing more American than that.",2023-06-08 20:13:48
"Apart from Trump being held accountable here, I can't help but wonder how insane of a situation this is for the GOP:

- There is nothing that prohibits someone under indictment or even a convict from running for President.  
- Trump is dominating the polls right now.  
- Trump is possibly the world's biggest narcissist.  
- Trump has no real convictions to the Republican Party beyond what it does for him personally.

Here's the kicker:

The GOP primaries begin in February, and the majority are over by March.

Trump's first trial (probably) doesn't begin until March. Afterwards, he may be facing both the DOJ and Fulton County.

It's possible we could see someone running as the GOP nominee while facing three separate criminal trials. ..Possibly someone running for the GOP nominee as a convict.

Desantis could catch up in polling, or the RNC could try to make a move to oust him, but this is all playing with fire. I could see someone like Trump threatening a third party, which he has [publicly suggested](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-2024-third-party-b2253265.html) already.",2023-06-08 16:55:21

Please understand that your initial reflex to jump to Trump’s defense and throw out numerous “what about-isms” that you think change a thing is completely natural. Before putting those thoughts out into the world for people to suffer through, think about the actual reasons. 

Trump repeatedly refused to cooperate with the NARA, lied about having records, and continued to keep records he was not permitted to keep after the DoJ subpoenaed those files. Even now, there are missing documents. 

If you want to say “what about Hillary?” Or “Hunter this” or “Biden that”

Answer this: Do their hypothetical unproven crimes excuse Trump’s crimes? Does someone robbing a store and not getting caught mean the cops can’t charge someone for car theft? No.

Trump is on tape acknowledging he shouldn’t have those records. If anyone else had these documents, they would be in jail.

* Garland appointed Jack Smith to be indendepent and follow the facts, he did.

* Jack smith followed the process of the law, gathered witnesses, subponea... and held a grand jury.

* the Grand Jury voted to indict on 7 counts.

* Donald Trump's right's have not been violated, he will get his day in court, he will need to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by 12 of his peers

* BUT BIDEN! Garland appointed another special counsel to follow up on Biden's documents as well. If there is legal action to be taken, it should be. That said, a crime committed by Biden, is not a free pass to Trump

* 4 counts under Obstruction of Justice

   * 1x 'Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy'

* 2 counts under Fraud and False Statements ('Statements or entries generally')

There's a great part (pg 9) with multiple quotes of Trump from 2016 harping about the importance of security clearances and handling of classified information, in light of Hillary's emails lmao

Edit: also, per the indictment doc, the 31 counts are only for some of the documents the FBI found at Mar-a-Lago AFTER Trump had boxes of documents taken to NJ, he went thru them, and put some of them back to MaL. The story told before suggests there could be loads of other docs at his Bedminster club or elsewhere. I assume those have since been retrieved by FBI et al, but I haven't really followed it.

Now we can all ban books and you don’t even need to read them or be accurate about it. Heck, you don’t even need to see the book!”

>“Incest, onanism, bestiality, prostitution, genital mutilation, fellatio, dildos, rape, and even infanticide,” the parent, who noted that they have actually read the Bible, wrote. “You’ll no doubt find that the Bible, under Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-1227, has ‘no serious values for minors’ because it’s pornographic by our new definition.”

If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.

The old-school read the NKJ (New King James) which is the oldest translation that is widely available, and the Church of Christ and other more “modern” denominations use NIV (New International Version.)

The rub here is that while these different churches have spats with each other over ideology, they still would have an absolute fit if one of the versions was not available… even though they don’t read that version.  Because if you can’t read what the other guy is reading, you can’t persecute them for it.

To account for this we should remember, that the doctrine of toleration was not then known, or had not prevailed in the world. Persecution was therefore not so much the fault of the sect as of the times. It was not in those days deemed wrong in itself. The general opinion was only, that those who are in error ought not to persecute the truth: But the possessors of truth were in the right to persecute error, in order to destroy it. Thus every sect believing itself possessed of all truth, and that every tenet differing from theirs was error, conceived that when the power was in their hands, persecution was a duty required of them by that God whom they supposed to be offended with heresy. -Ben Franklin, 1772",2023-03-25 18:02:07

"There's a mixture of reasons why, but lack of literacy isn't necessarily the reason.

One of the reasons is that the bible is, well, _big_.

Reading through it in a year is a goal for some, and not because they are bad readers.

Then you have to look at what translation you're going to use, and you run into more problems because older translations (such as the New King James translation), and translations based on those translations, tend to use language which can be more difficult to puzzle out.  That makes it more mentally taxing, which both slows you down, and reduces how much you can read at a go.

And much of it can be...  Boring as fuck.

Don't get me wrong, there's some absolutely _wild_ shit in there if you actually read it, but if you're trying to read it front to back...  It's not that hard to get bogged down, and to find other stuff that you find more enjoyable to do.

Impeachment of Supreme Court Justice

*Over the country’s history, 15 federal judges have been impeached, and eight removed from office; others resigned in the wake of scandal instead. So one thing, at least, is clear: Unlike for presidents, there is ample precedent for firing federal judges via impeachment. Though no Supreme Court justice has ever been removed this way, there have been two attempts. Thomas is not immune to this constitutional remedy simply by virtue of sitting on the nation’s highest court.*
[Source](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/03/30/impeach-supreme-court-justice-clarence-thomas-00021480)

*The United States Constitution provides that the House of Representatives ""shall have the sole Power of Impeachment"" (Article I, section 2) and ""the Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments … [but] **no person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present""** (Article I, section 3). The president, vice president, and all civil officers of the United States are subject to impeachment.*    
[Source](https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/impeachment.htm)

(Emphasis mine)  

Translation:  
A simple majority of House votes can impeach, but it takes 2/3 of Senate votes to confirm that impeachment.

That’s really the point of the Republican effort to undermine every branch of the system: they can make laws for their own benefit, fail to enforcement them against their own, and strike down any law they disapprove of (or use the courts to carve out new powers for themselves). They don’t even need to be in the majority to do it; they needed only to recognize the ways in which their power could be used in self-serving ways.

The choice not to vote, not to participate, to say ""it doesn't affect me, it won't matter"", is fully to blame for this, as even if a representative lies, they can be removed within a few years as long as the majority of the population participates and is aware of how the system works, or faster if more of the people focus on voting in people with solid track records and real integrity. It's not merely about good faith.

The weakness in the system was the fact that we were not prepared for modern propaganda which encourages people to avoid their civic duty, or fall for racist conspiracies. That we allowed civic education to collapse.

"You'd need Stretch Armstrong to get a grip on how twisted and far reaching the corruption of the Thomas's goes. 

Trees can drop a rotton branch and sprout new ones, but you have to cut out the rot, and deviant growths. Nothing is enherantly perfect.

The judicial branch has to be kept in check and ballance with the exective, and legislative branches. This system was designed to be incompatible with political parties. I seem to remember George Washington writing as much, and warning that a two party system would be a nightmare. Seeing how the interplay between our dominant parties is fucking up the foundational stability of our government, I'd say that prediction came to pass.

Awareness is the enemy of manipulators. Education and knowledge in the hands of the common folk are the pathway to a better life. Anyone who says otherwise has something to gain by keeping us unaware, and unknowing. What we don't know can in fact harm us the most. Slavers want stupid slaves. 

The protesters in Atlanta Georgia are being charged with domestic terrorism for speaking up. Here's the thing, the government must respect the will of the governed to be defined as democratic. The further we move away from democracy, the further we fall into autocracy, that's when the government does what it wants and tells us to fuck off. The corporations are already there and bribing for their will, so it's more of an Oligarchy.

The executive branch attracts our attention because it's headed by one person. We can deal with that. However, the other two branches have loads of people involved, so it's easier to ""pass the buck"". 

The supreme court has been tweaked throughout history. We've had more justices, and we've had fewer. We need to get rid of anyone in any part of the government that works against the general welfare. We need to reinact Glass-Steagle, and to enforce antitrust laws that have been ignored and defanged. We need to remove ""citizens united"" and take back the power of speech. Money is not speech. I can't pay my bills with words alone. Crimes aren't punishable by ""$2000 or a 50000 word essay"" it's cash and/or jail time.  That's life, not speech.

The supreme court defined the exchange of cash as a form of speech to legalize the bribery. If not, Thomas may have been caught years ago. the foxes have been making the rules for the henhouse for a while, and got sloppy and lazy. Government is public service to promote the general welfare of its citizens. It's not supposed to be a moneymaking venture. It's not supposed to be a path to wealth. The wealthy have a stranglehold on government because they have the time and money, the two resources they keep us short on. 

The people who faught and died to give us a liveable workday, with safety measures, breaks, and a weekend, were regular people. At Blair mountain They stood up to the police, the Pinkerton's, the cannons and gunfire of strike breakers. The battle of Blair mountain is an illustration of how the working class is entitled only to what we are willing to fight for. When our ""entitlements"" are getting cut and attacked, it's an attack on us. Our history is full of conflicts on our soil that earned our freedoms, but those are not in the history they want to teach the youth, in a country founded in protest.

George Washington, 1796 (from his brilliant farewell address)

*****

The trouble is that the Founders, for all of their wisdom, created a system which is fundamentally flawed.  The equal representation for all states in the Senate sealed the deal of creating the US, but also virtually guaranteed our country would eventually end up ever more undemocratic.  The FPTP system means that any vote perceived to be for a ""3rd"" candidate is wasted, which therefore makes two rival political parties a game theory certainty.  The lifetime appointment of Supreme Court justices has allowed corruption to flourish and gamesmanship around the appointments to pay off handsomely while making the makeup of the court a matter of lucky timing of deaths rather than reflecting any notion of what The People have demanded via their votes.  We have a 6-3 GOP appointed court in a nation that's only voted for the GOP candidate 1 time in the last 8 Presidential elections.  The system is broken.

They built a wonderful thing when they founded the USA, but ~250 years into the experiment it's becoming clear that we need some kind of reset of the rules to account for what we've learned.  The problem there is that we need the ones who've won the game to do what Washington once did: voluntarily give up power for the greater good.",2023-05-06 14:12:30
"When the Constitution was written, the Supreme Court wasn't seen as a particularly important branch of government. For the first few decades of the court's existence, most of their time was spent as basically circuit judges, going from city to city as basically appeals court judges.

It wasn't until Marlbury v. Madison, where judicial review was established (something that some originalists still reject) that the court actually became important.

Still, everyone regarded a Supreme Court position as a measure of the appointee's gravitas, something you earned from long years as a judge, showing your credentials. (Not always, of course, Taft was appointed after having served as President.)  It was George Bush's insight to appoint a young judge who could be expected to serve reliably for decades, and who was thoroughly vetted by the Federalist Society so that they knew who they were getting. That's what to expect now; Republicans don't appoint judges, they appoint rubber stamps. You never have to ask about, say, abortion, in the confirmation hearings, because that's already been established.

None of this can change without a Constitutional amendment, which of course will never happen. There are all sorts of wild-hair ideas like court packing, or creating some sort of system where you have a large pool of justices and a random selection is picked to hear each individual case... none of that will happen because it requires Republicans to agree to it, and there's no reason for them to agree when the board is tilted so decisively in their favor.",2023-05-06 09:57:24

Just look at the lawsuit that Fox News had to pay 3/4 of $1 billion for lying to those who watch Fox News. We have half the nation being lied to and they keep on voting Republican and this is why we can’t convict an impeachment.

Justices were making arguments in at least as bad of Faith as Thomas and Alito 150 years ago without the level of direct access to their opinions by anyone. Whether their votes and stated opinions were bought part and parcel like Thomas's I'm not positive.  

Now that his corruption is established I am oddly slightly less upset each time I find out he was actually bribed significantly more than the previous estimate or that extra steps were taken to hide it.

"Modern Republican politicians have always been dirty and not at all afraid to manipulate and bend or break rules and conventions, even fabricating facts when it suits them.

Democrats, on the other hand, take the high road, 
and treat politics through a lens of idealism, as if the other side of the aisle acts in good faith and it's just a mere difference of opinion that separates them rather than a lack of empathy and a disregard for anyone who isn't a wealthy donor.  It is because of this belief that their Republican colleagues are essentially good people that the Democratic party has consistently been moving farther and farther right in an attempt to be inclusive. The Democrats propose something moderate, the Republicans call it radical and socialist, the Democrats then compromise and throw out 60% of their proposal, and the GOP moves the goalposts again and again until their idea is 10% of what it once was and now includes 90% of the GOP's wishlist as well as some kickbacks to their donors. 

Part of the solution to the increasingly dire problem we face is ranked-choice voting, an end to the electoral college, automatically mailed ballots, an end to voter supression masquerading as fraud prevention, judicial reform, strong consumer and workers' rights, campaign finance reform, and maybe some basic decency and empathy toward each other (e.g. stop shooting everything that moves or interacts with you.

Or just a call back to an older divide between the Roman and Greek worlds with the rise of Christianity where the western world viewed Christianity through the lens of a Roman legal model (Roman Catholicism and Protestant churches) versus how the  Greek world (Eastern Orthodoxy) looked at the same revelation and was more experiential, mystical about it.",2023-05-06 14:41:51

*“I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing,” Feinstein says. “You come in here and you say, ‘It has to be my way or the highway.’ I don’t respond to that.”*

*“I’ve gotten elected. I just ran,” she continues. “I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality, and I know what I’m doing. So, you know, maybe people should listen a little bit.”*

> California Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing calls to resign as her ill health has seen her miss around three-quarters of all Senate votes this year, impacting President Joe Biden&#039;s judicial nominees.

> Since March 7, Feinstein has missed a further 58 Senate votes, meaning she has failed to vote in 60 votes of the 82 Senate votes taken in 2023 so far.

> There are now calls from Democratic figures for Feinstein to resign from office while noting her absence is preventing the Senate from confirming justices.

You cannot tell me that 
A) In 31 years Dianne (or Mitch, Nancy, Chuck, Sanford, Earl, Sherrod, Joe, Richard, Ken, Maria, Benjamin, Thomas, Steve, James... I could go on, but I won't) hasn't been bought and paid for by special interests.
B) She didn't lose touch with, and interest in, the people she is supposed to represent.
C) At 89 years old, she isn't just temporarily incapable of showing up for the votes (**damn near all of them, at that**), she flat-out hasn't been capable of knowing what in the hell she's voting ABOUT for *years*.

What she, and her staff, are doing right now is frankly shameful. She needs to retire immediately. She's no longer fit to serve and her unfitness is impact the functioning of the government and the Biden administration.",2023-04-12 09:57:49

Apr 12 2023  
San Francisco—Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today released the following statement on her medical diagnosis and when she plans to return to Washington:  
“When I was first diagnosed with shingles, I expected to return by the end of the March work period. Unfortunately, my return to Washington has been delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.  
“I intend to return as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel. In the meantime, I remain committed to the job and will continue to work from home in San Francisco.  
“I understand that my absence could delay the important work of the Judiciary Committee, so I’ve asked Leader Schumer to ask the Senate to allow another Democratic senator to temporarily serve until I’m able to resume my committee work.”",2023-04-12 19:35:52

"Age limits is one of those things that can be a slippery slope. In spirit, it makes total sense. But in practice, I can absolutely see it being abused. Let's take a step back and ask what the core problem is though: how the hell are these old fuckers all getting elected? It's not because they are old, or necessarily because they are ""experienced"". It's because corporations/the rich/big donors/dark money/etc. give them a bunch of money since they are going to be reliable allies once in office. If we all of a sudden take away these dinosaurs ability to generate a fuck ton of campaign money to follow their corpo overlords interests, and force them to actually get on the campaign trail and convince the average voter to donate, then we would be working to solve the big problem.  
  
So instead of focusing on old people getting elected (which is not a problem inherent of itself), let's focus on fighting against the reason they are getting elected which is a much, much bigger issue IMO.  
  
I'd take is a step further and argue that staying hyper-focused on age-limits is exactly the kind of issue they want you to stay focused on, because it's going nowhere, fast. Young people who would vote for age-limits don't turn out to vote, and old people who do turn out to vote won't vote for age-limits. As legislation, congressional age-limits is DOA.

She lives in a gated community where a random black woman being in her neighborhood walking her dog would shock her and she'd look into it. 

You know why I know this for a fact? Her gated community prevented a Chinese couple from buying a house there. So what these genius God bless them capitalist American heroes did was they found out the private gated community hadn't paid their state taxes for decades. And of course it's a place with rich white assholes in political power. So what this Chinese couple did was glorious. They paid 40 something years of Back taxes to the state of California. Then they set up a toll booth to enter the road to the gated community.

"Lifelong Democrats who were democrats before the 60's joined a party that had *significantly* different race relations than the one we have now. It is important to remember that the original divide on civil rights was not Democrats/Republicans but North/South, and the south was entirely dominated by the Democratic Party.

It was not until the Civil Rights movement that the Democrats moved into the moderate left (as opposed to being mixed) and the Republicans, in response to that, enacted the ""Southern Strategy"" under the advisement of a bunch of Chrisitan Dominionists who really hated de-segregation. 

This is the voting [map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Senate_vote_on_final_passage_of_Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964_%28HR_7152%29.png/1920px-Senate_vote_on_final_passage_of_Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964_%28HR_7152%29.png) for how the votes were divided on civil rights. While the Democrats were already doing slightly better on race relations by the time it came to a vote, the divide was still stark. 

Of the 22 southern senators that voted, 21 were democrats, and of those 21 only one voted *for* the Civil Rights Act. This is why Republicans will pretend that the Democratic Party is more racist than them, because they can accurately say that more Democrats voted against the act than Republicans. Conveniently leaving out the fact that the Democrats were the party of the south at the time, a role that the Republicans now fill, and both inherited the will of the same segment of society.",2023-04-12 11:59:23

"Eh, I don't know about other places but here in PA, the republicans claimed that Shapiro(D) spent money to make ads that made pennsylvanians vote for Mastriano in the republican primary.  


That really didn't happen though. Shapiro did use money against Mastriano to showcase how much of a nutbar he was to try to knock him down as a candidate. He might have spent a million or so. The thing is that Mastriano won the republican primary by 20% over the next candidate, which means that if Shapiro moved the dial that much on the voting, he missed a great career in political campaigning.    


The thing is that Mastriano was not a popular candidate in his own party, he got around 40% of the party voting for him in the primary.  Potentially turned off by the crazy, maybe helped by the ads.

* Something good happens -> It came from god(s)
* Something bad happens -> It is your fault for being a dirty sinner/tainted soul/etc.

It’s the same way abusers keep their victims from feeling any sense of control. All the big religions, and most of the small ones have scriptures (and all the other words for yourspecific religious texts) that write out the message of an habitual abuser:

* Love me first before all things
* Love me even when my plan hurts you most
* Love me or suffer to varying degrees, including eternity
* If your loved ones don’t love me, get rid of them
* Gimme money to show me love
* When I hurt you badly, it is just love you don’t understand

Just don’t do religion and the world will immediately begin to improve. People outsource their morality not just to books, but to the people who interpret those books for them. Most of them don’t even really READ the damn books and if they do they have someone there to reinterpret heinous and abhorrent acts found within the pages, stuff that would immediately be known as immoral today.

"> The New Testament is where it says women should obey their husbands like men obey god and can’t preach or teach or have authority over a man and must remain submissive and silent, and that god makes men and women gay as punishment for idolatry and then punishes them again for being gay.

Interestingly, most modern biblical scholars believe the letters where this is from (who claim to be written by Paul), to not actually be letters written by Paul. The reason for that is in the genuine Paul letters he addresses some letters to women by name, suggesting that some of the churches that were founded by Paul were led by women and he had no isse with that. Then suddenly some later letters he starts writing how women should not speak etc. There are differences in writing style, word usage, and theology as well.

Now that doesn't mean Paul was a feminist or anything (he still lived about 2000 years ago lol), but it does suggest that the early church was partly led by women and then in a generation or two became much more patriarchal.

> There’s tons of absolutely abhorrent stuff in the NT, including support for slavery and instructing slaves to obey their masters.

The various canonical letters suggest some very interesting conflicts in the early church, partly because of the different social classes between the early Christians. Obviously the pro hierarchy, pro status quo faction ended up winning out.

Caveat: I am neither a Christian nor a biblical scholar, I just like reading about stuff like this.

For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’ Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.”

Matthew 10:34 “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

"A judge ruled my ex was responsible for 75% of our shared debts at divorce. (He earned significantly more than me at the time.) The debt was hospital bills from the birth of our child and they were in my name. (It shouldn’t cost $10K to have a baby but that’s a different issue.) 

My ex also wouldn’t pay child support until the state garnished his wages which took close to a year. He was also required to pay preschool tuition but then wouldn’t so that I couldn’t go to work. Our kid got kicked out multiple times because he wouldn’t pay. It was so embarrassing and disruptive. Once the child support started being managed by the state, we never missed a payment. 

So even as a single mom doing everything on my own, I paid all the hospital bills and never got a penny from my ex. I tried to explain to my ex what happens when a court finds someone in contempt but he didn’t believe me. 

A year+ later after several attempts to find a solution, I asked the judge to hold my ex in contempt of court for failing to pay his part. 

That’s when things got interesting. 

When we split, my ex went into a pretty nasty downward spiral. He was partying hard. His car got repo’d. He lost a ton of weight (likely through anorexia). He was riding his bicycle one night and was so wasted that he crashed and apparently it was bad enough that he or someone else called 911 and he was taken to the hospital. 

Close to a year later, on the morning of the contempt hearing, he knew he was in trouble. So he called up the hospital and said he needed to pay some bills. He gave them his information and sure enough— he had a whole bunch of unpaid hospital bills! He gave them everything he could afford and then proudly told everyone in court about his large payment. He felt that it should be subtracted from the total he was supposed to pay. 

I knew immediately that *he’d paid his own bills.* It took everything in me to not start cackling. The judge, however, was a little more confused. He got the hospital billing department on the line and put them on speaker for the whole room to hear. They initially didn’t believe he was a judge so they weren’t willing to release the billing information. This only made the judge more pissed off. It took at least 15 minutes for everyone to realize what a complete dumbass this guy was. 

My attorney requested that the judge require my ex to pay 100% of our shared debt. He agreed! The options were: come up with all the money in three days or report to jail, or, wait for us to come find you. 

My ex began loudly whining, “I can’t pay that! I just spent all my money!” The judge was basically like, “Tough shit” and walked out.

"Your story reads so much like the story of someone I know but at the same time very different.

The only benefit that she had that made it so things didn't take years to deal with with child support was that there was a few people at the court house that knew her, and a few people there that knew him. 

He lied every chance he got, even if it wasn't useful. He faked injuries to try to claim he couldn't work. And he was self employeed so he could hide all of his income... which turned out to be a really bad idea. 

The judge couldn't use his income to determine how much child support to pay because he hide it all. But... he also was paying $3k+ in bills every month. Would literally show up saying he made $300 that month, and had $3k in bills for the month but wouldn't say how he paid the $3k. 

So the judge said 'well you have a CDL, you have these skills, you obviously are working because of these photos presented. I think you can pay $1500 a month, so you will.'

3 months would go by and he wouldn't pay anything, so she would convince the courts to drag him back in with a 'pay in 24 hours or else'. And he paid every single time. It went on for like a year before he went to jail for something else. 

Funny enough, he is in jail, has ""no income"" and he still owns everything he had bills on, including his house. But again won't pay child support. Though I think she gave up trying.",2023-01-20 12:15:30

">Shell have to ask formally and jump through hoops.

It's work, but it's not that hard *if someone actually has assets*.

As a former landlord who had one particularly noteworthy deadbeat tenant ... after eviction, it became clear that she really had no assets at all.  No bank accounts we could find to go after, her vehicle was leased so she didn't actually own it, etc. etc.

But she had a job, and we knew who her employer was - so we were able to bring our county judgement paperwork to her (large international) employer ... whose HR department doesn't fuck around with shit like that.  They garnished a portion of her wages for about 4 years until we were made whole.

If she had assets, it would have been easier.  If she had a bank account, we could have filed a bank lien.  So I think with Hillary getting something out of Trump, it won't actually be that hard since his ownership of various real estate assets is well documented.  So the easiest course for her and her attorneys would be to send a letter saying ""we expect your payment within 30 days"" and then when Trump obviously ignores that (because it would absolutely break his brain to write Hillary Clinton a check) then her attorneys file a lien against Mar-A-Lago for said amount - because she doesn't actually need $171k ... but it will piss him off to no end.",2023-01-20 09:43:24

"Sanctions that go this far are extremely uncommon.  You have to file and pursue a wholly meritless case for an improper purpose.

These sanctions aren't even the relatively common ""Rule 11"" sanctions.  These were ordered under the inherent authority of the court;  the judge explains at length that the ordinary rules are insufficient to deter this kind of blatant misuse of the judicial system and builds on top of them.

Because this is a Federal case that received a great deal of attention, you can find some good analysis by legal commentators as well as get the source documents easily.

The CourtListener project provides a public mirror of the Federal PACER system, and I like that major outlets often link directly or mirror those source docs.   NYT linked directly to the sanctions order today:

"No, the cases are not that different at all. Both cases of an individual (both minorities, coincidentally?) who voted while mistakenly believing they were eligible and not knowing they were legally ineligible. Ortega did not intentionally lie about being a citizen, she checked a box saying she was a citizen, and was convicted on that basis, but the evidence clearly showed she thought she was eligible as a permanent resident with a green card. 

> Birdsall characterized Ortega as a poorly educated woman who, as a lawful permanent resident all of her adult life, was unaware that she was not permitted to vote. Her indictment in November 2015 followed a series of actions she revealed to elections officials and law enforcement investigators.

> After moving from Dallas to neighboring Tarrant County in late 2014, she attempted to register to vote but indicated on her application that she was not an American citizen. When her application was rejected, she called election administrators and was told that the reason for the rejection was that she had checked the ""no"" box for citizenship. Ortega explained that she had been able to vote in Dallas County and resubmitted her voter registration, this time indicating she was a citizen. 

> Several months later, Ortega was visited on her front porch by two investigators from Paxton's office. They secretly recorded Ortega as she said she checked the box indicating she was a citizen because she had previously encountered no trouble voting in Dallas County. 

> It was Ortega's poor luck that she had just confessed to illegal voting in a state where elected officials made examples of those they deemed contributors to voter fraud.

"Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe, I was just outside Barcelona, hiking in the foothills of mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path, and I came to a clearing, and there was a lake, very secluded, and there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw, George Santos, bathing himself, but he was crying...

I hesitated, watching, struck by George's beauty. And also by how his presence; the delicate curve of his back, the dark sweep of his hair, the graceful length of his limbs, even his tears, added to the majesty of my surroundings. I felt my own tears burning behind my eyes, not in sympathy, but in appreciation of such a perfect moment.

George spied me before I could compose myself. But he didn't cry out. Instead our eyes held and he smiled, enigmatically, fresh tears still spilling down his cheeks. I was frozen. At the time I knew nothing of George Santos, and yet, as we stood on opposite sides of a pool of water, thousands of miles from my own home and everyone I had ever known, I felt the most intense connection. Not just to him, but to the earth, the sky, the water between us. And also to the entirety of mankind. As if he symbolized thousands of years of the human condition.

I wanted to go to him, to comfort him, to probe this feeling of belonging I had never encountered before. But I couldn't. Because I knew that if I spoke, if he spoke, that moment would be ruined. And I knew I would need the memory of that moment to carry me through the inevitable dark patches throughout my life.

And so I watched George lower his hand, turn, and slowly walk to the shore opposite me. The rest of his perfect form was gradually revealed to me, and I held my breath as I watched her disappear behind a copse of trees near the water.

I didn't follow him, in fact I turned around. I knew there was nothing else we could experience together that would be more perfect than that moment...and it still remains the most profound experience of my life",2023-01-12 23:19:25

"It's still wild to me that people could watch Colbert 5 times a week and not get it. I was in high school during peak Colbert and it was clear as day to me he was taking the piss out of Bush and Republicans.

I feel like my parents fell into that, too. I never knew them to watch Colbert, maybe I was too off in my own world, but they were pretty enthused and excited for his taking over of The Late Show. Which was definitely the only time they've ever been into late night television. That was until Colbert started getting politically topical again after the 2016 elections, but this time without the satire. That shit got turned off *fast* by my dad.",2023-01-12 22:28:18

My homeroom teacher was one of 'the cool' teachers in that he kinda broke the mold of most teachers and was really into older rock so I always thought he was liberal and kind of an old hippie. Turns out I was wrong. Every morning we'd have the dumb little TV play 10 minutes of news updates and I'd argue with him constantly that invading Iraq was just an imperialistic scam to flex military muscle, steal oil, and kill Saddam. I was really surprised he supported the invasion as much as he did. The funniest part of it, though, is at the time I was basing a lot of my opinions on what I got from Infowars... glad I got off that train when I did!",2023-01-13 08:31:42

But ouch, the secondhand cringe is potent at the end of that story! I sympathize. But I have a question, and I'm not trying to call you out or anything, but if the joke depended on the homophobic audience and catching them off-guard was the funny part (which I can dig) then why the fuck would you try it with people who you didn't *know* to be homophobic? I can understand joking about the wrong stuff in front of the wrong people, but damn. 


Though, when you're living in basically a homophobic society like you were, you can forget that not everyone is like that when you go somewhere else. I suspect that part of the draw of the joke, for you, was getting a laugh out of other people besides the target of the joke, and you probably enjoyed the attention of the folks who thought it was funny to see you make their friends uncomfortable -- and there's nothing wrong with that! At least you had the self-awareness to retire that joke, instead of blaming others for not ""getting it"" or being too ""PC"" as some people tend to. Making mistakes and learning from them is good -- everyone does the former, but too few manage to do the latter.

"Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

“The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

The underlying algorithm that helped to build Bard, Google’s conversational A.I. service, is partly trained on Reddit data. OpenAI’s Chat GPT cites Reddit data as one of the sources of information it has been trained on.

Other companies are also beginning to see value in the conversations and images they host. Shutterstock, the image hosting service, also sold image data to OpenAI to help create DALL-E, the A.I. program that creates vivid graphical imagery with only a text-based prompt required.

Last month, Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, said he was cracking down on the use of Twitter’s A.P.I., which thousands of companies and independent developers use to track the millions of conversations across the network. Though he did not cite L.L.M.s as a reason for the change, the new fees could go well into the tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.

To keep improving their models, artificial intelligence makers need two significant things: an enormous amount of computing power and an enormous amount of data. Some of the biggest A.I. developers have plenty of computing power but still look outside their own networks for the data needed to improve their algorithms. That has included sources like Wikipedia, millions of digitized books, academic articles and Reddit.

Representatives from Google, Open AI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Reddit has long had a symbiotic relationship with the search engines of companies like Google and Microsoft. The search engines “crawl” Reddit’s web pages in order to index information and make it available for search results. That crawling, or “scraping,” isn’t always welcome by every site on the internet. But Reddit has benefited by appearing higher in search results.

The dynamic is different with L.L.M.s — they gobble as much data as they can to create new A.I. systems like the chatbots.

Reddit believes its data is particularly valuable because it is continuously updated. That newness and relevance, Mr. Huffman said, is what large language modeling algorithms need to produce the best results.

“More than any other place on the internet, Reddit is a home for authentic conversation,” Mr. Huffman said. “There’s a lot of stuff on the site that you’d only ever say in therapy, or A.A., or never at all.”

Mr. Huffman said Reddit’s A.P.I. would still be free to developers who wanted to build applications that helped people use Reddit. They could use the tools to build a bot that automatically tracks whether users’ comments adhere to rules for posting, for instance. Researchers who want to study Reddit data for academic or noncommercial purposes will continue to have free access to it.

Reddit also hopes to incorporate more so-called machine learning into how the site itself operates. It could be used, for instance, to identify the use of A.I.-generated text on Reddit, and add a label that notifies users that the comment came from a bot.

The company also promised to improve software tools that can be used by moderators — the users who volunteer their time to keep the site’s forums operating smoothly and improve conversations between users. And third-party bots that help moderators monitor the forums will continue to be supported.

But for the A.I. makers, it’s time to pay up.

“Crawling Reddit, generating value and not returning any of that value to our users is something we have a problem with,” Mr. Huffman said. “It’s a good time for us to tighten things up.”

“We think that’s fair,” he added.",2023-06-19 01:13:12

"It's not ironic. It was never really a legitimate concern to them at all. It was simply another angle of attack against the other team. That's all 70-80% of the concerns with Biden are.

Personally, I think it's a shitty pool of candidates, and really don't want to have to vote for Biden, but probably will if these are the final options, simply because he's the least dangerous option to go with. We *should* be picking from the best and brightest among us to represent us on a world stage and lead us into a better tomorrow, through the several catastrophic threats looming on the horizon.

Literally the only thing wrong with him that I’ve seen is he has a stuttering problem, which has seemed to worsen with age, but he seems to always be trying to do his best to get around it when talking. But of course, people these days are rabid animals and just attack him for one weakness.

Except for one or two small things, everything he’s said, done, and the values he’s shown are things I adore. Would Bernie have been more progressive?

"I’m also voting for Biden because:

1) He will appoint liberal justices. A Republican in the WH + R Senate = SCOTUS going even further right and overturning Obergefell within 5-10 years. Not to mention eroding voting rights, abortion rights/possibly even birth control, etc.

2) Biden is far better on climate, look at how much money he got for green infrastructure in the IRA. He’s also designated a lot of lands to be protected nationally. Yes he expanded some oil drilling but we live in a country where high gas prices is political suicide. Biden is helping us transition off of it w/ green infrastructure money but we need to have something in the meantime. Plus environmental protections are stronger in the US so I’d rather get domestic oil rather than buy from Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc.

3) Obergefell and the courts aside Biden is friendly to the LGBT community. No trans bans in the military or anything like that

4) Supports Ukraine and has spurred a lot of other countries to support Ukraine as well. Ukraine is important not only because they are a victim of Russian aggression, but if Russia wins this war it’s open season on a lot of smaller and weaker countries. Ukraine winning will make wars of conquest look far less appealing & will make the world more peaceful.

5) Supports NATO, falls into the Ukraine/foreign policy area but very important to me

"Even if we could, messaging mostly falls on deaf ears anyway.  Back when I had Twitter and decided to follow a couple politicians i was interested in, it was non-stop notifications from them. All hours of the day, until I turned them off.

Maybe it’s just me, but it all just seems like a self-defeating loop.  What Reddit *thinks* it’s asking for by “messaging” is some kind of masterfully designed unified propaganda campaign targeting the whole electorate, not realizing what they’re *actually* asking for is messaging targeting *ourselves*, who are not unified or interested in that.  Reddit spends all its time demonizing “centrists” (aka literally anything to the right of Bernie, hur dur Overton window) because Reddit only comprehends one strategy: the one trick pony that is “blue wave”, summoning a secret legion of exclusively disenchanted far leftists… i.e. themselves, to rise up and crush all center-left AND conservative resistance.  

The problem is A) what Reddit is asking for doesn’t even work on us, because it already is and has been shouted at us all day everyday, while we all hang out *behind a wall of algorithms that knows we won’t listen or respond to that kind of thing.*.  And B) what *actually* works on us in *not* deliberate messaging, but extremely low effort low brow **memes and jokes** (see: Dark Brandon). 

I’ve said it a million times: the entire left is terrible at messaging anyway, both in delivery and receiving it compared to conservatives.  Whereas conservatives barely have any ideology to speak of and doesn’t to affect them anyway, the left is a wildly disjointed and disunified mess that, sorry to say it folks, does include a large amount of bat shit.  We can’t even decide if our slogans mean what they say, or exactly the *opposite* of what they say.   Half of us are trying to appeal to moderates with individual common sense solutions, from the modest to the radical, while the other half is constantly scaring everyone off with insane Utopianism, incredulously scoffing as though most of America is a bunch of closeted leninists just waiting for the signal to abolish all capitalism.",2023-06-19 06:14:01

"Bingo, well said, and additionally in Germany the Nazi's did not hold a majority in the Reichstag when Hitler was elected Chancellor(they held a plurality with around 30% of seats). Hindenburg and the conservative Catholics, Monarchists and Junkers thought they could manipulate the Nazis and use their fervent base in Bavaria, and The Communist Party and Social Democrats couldn't coalesce and effectively oppose him. 

Hitler used the disunity and political squabbling amid the chaos of the Reichstag Fire(which the Nazi's almost certainly set) to gain the support of the moderate Catholic party, who voted for him in the hopes of stabilizing the situation. Turns put a strongman stoking chaos and then promising to bring law and order isn't really a new playbook. 

All to say, I totally agree, and with both Desantis and Trump explicitly promising to gut the executive agencies and fill them with partisans, as well as Trump having the Caesaresque motivation of needing to stay president to avoid criminal prosection(which was a danger also shared by Hitler), the consequences of not unifying will almost certainly be incredibly dire.",2023-06-18 21:12:36

He hasn't introduced it every year, but [every elected congress](https://www.congress.gov/member/adam-schiff/S001150?q=%7B%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22joint-resolutions%22%7D), so every 2 years.  It first started with the 112th congress (2011-2012) to today's 118th congress (2023-2024).  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.",2023-01-19 18:57:54

Now fast forward 100 years into the future and see what each nation looks like. I imagine the difference would be astounding. One would probably be poverty stricken with a flat tax bracket. Everyone pay x%. No go to the other one and taxes would be high. However, healthcare is free. Education is a priority, and people work less hours and make more money. The overall quality of life is better. Guns are banned, crime is down, and there are significantly less people in prisons.

OP:

Regardless of what this thing looks like on its face, has everyone forgotten how difficult it is to get a Constitutional Amendment passed? For reference, the most recent (27th) Amendment was first proposed in September of 1789, and only passed in May of 1992. (For those of us who can't do math in our heads, that's a 203 year time lag.)

This is a loud effort for the sole purpose going nowhere except to point fingers at the folks (again in House majority) who passed this $#!+ legislation to begin with.

Or, if you prefer, another one of those ""I watched the Ghandi documentary"" weak position gambits the kind-hearted, lovely, flailing-armed left is famous for.

<rant> I love you useless f*ckers, but grow some guts, would ya? Our head honcho is a guy who can't stay upright on a bicycle. We seriously voted for this jackass ONLY because he was the one person up for grabs who wasn't naturally bent toward starting a war for the sake of economics.

"That is true.  Right now, and for the past 40-plus years, We have had the best government money could buy, and it is thoroughly corrupt.  Money may not be ""The root of all evil"", but it is a big assist.

Other evidence is also out there:  The Meeting in Davos, Switzerland and the associated protests, which incidentally, are out in the cold (I understand Greta Thunberg was ""briefly detained"").  The firing of Scientist Rose Abramoff, from Oak Ridge, for being an advocate for Environmental and Climate Science (I personally, can identify with that; political expediency almost always wins, over The Public Good); and if I had any illusions about PBS, and the programs; ""Newshour"", and ""Nova""; having not been compromised by contributors; they have been dispelled.

Tonight's ""Newshour"" was brought to you, by the Monetarists; who were eager to point out that The Civil War increased The Nation's Debt load, by 400, or 4000 percent (never mind the other issues, and that The Nation nearly tore itself, apart; and this may have been the most expensive War, in terms of life, and property damage; in The Nation's History), and ignored the damage done, by President Andrew Jackson, and The Republican Administrations; between 1924, and 1932; one leading to the Panic (Depression) of 1837, which lasted three to five years; the other, to the Great Depression, from 1929, to 1937, and its ""echo"", from 1937, to 1940.  I didn't care for the ""commercial"", for induction cooking, either.  Not very ""unbiased"", and highly suspect.

Last night's ""Nova"" was basically a commercial, for Dupont, The Oil Companies, and Koch Industries.  The presenter waxed poetic, over indestrutable plastics, and rubber; but didn't discuss how We get rid of these plastics, and rubber, when We are done with them.  I could give other examples, as well,  but suffice it to say, ""Nova"" has been bought, and paid for.

On a side note, ""Democracy, Now!"" Pointed out last night; that 70 percent of The Stocks, in this Country; and therefore  70 percent of Corporate Wealth, and Ownership; are in the hands of the top 5 percent (by wealth) of The Nation.  I suspect the holding of total wealth, and owed debt; is even worse (There has been no discussion of The Lorenz Curve, or Gini Coefficient, on PBS, as well; nor has Keynesian Economics, versus Monetarism; been discussed). On January 16, We celebrated Martin Luther King's Birthday, but ""Democracy Now!, was the only program that broadcast  three other King Speeches, in their entirety:  His speech, on Vietnam, and Beyond, Why He was in Memphis, supporting the Sanitation Workers, and his ""I've been to the Mountaintop"" Speech.

"Not 75% of the people, 75% of the *states.* That’s a huge difference because the population of the states is skewed wildly. A majority of the national population lives in a small handful of states, so you could theoretically have >75% support for an amendment and still have no shot at it passing. You could also have less than 50% support for it and have a good chance of it passing, provided it’s the right people in the right places who support it. “One person, one vote” does not exist in the United States—we do not have free and equal suffrage.

Oh, and constitutional amendments are approved by state legislatures, not by popular vote, so that’s another layer of abstraction. 

The whole process is very insulated from anything resembling popular sovereignty. In order to amend the constitution, you either need 3/4ths of the states to call a constitutional convention, or you need to pass it through the House (reasonably democratic), the Senate (undemocratically skewed), and 3/4ths of the state legislatures (undemocratically skewed), which entails passing it through the state senates (undemocratically skewed). 

It’s actually well within reach for a conservative amendment to be passed in the modern day, considering all the low-population states tend to be more conservative. But barring a massive political realignment, there will never be a progressive constitutional amendment again. That calls into question the legitimacy of the Constitution, as well as its viability as a vehicle for progressive change. Anyone who believes that there are still considerable social and political battles left to be won before we have a just society should be opposed to the US Constitution.",2023-01-20 05:54:47

"Like many many pieces of legislation, it’s introduced every Congress (in fact, typically there are a few versions) to show it’s a priority even if it obviously won’t pass. 

The introduction has a few purposes, allowing groups to cite the introduction and use that to raise awareness of the issue. It can also be important getting legislators on the record in favor/as cosponsors when it can’t pass to help pigeonhole them when it can (though a constitutional amendment is pretty far off IMO). 

I’d argue that most bills that become law are not the first introduction of that bill - aside from bills responsive to an emergent event.  Even then, huge sections of those bills are policies that legislators have been pushing beforehand. Think like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. That was responsive to an event, but included language from bills that had been introduced before.

Here is a summary of Butian's operation from the Sentencing Memo:

&#x200B;

>“As part of its larger efforts to target the United States, Russia has engaged and continues to engage in spot-and-assess operations,” which he described as intelligence operations that seek “to identify individual who could potentially be recruited an intelligence asset — or ‘source’ — at a later date.”  
The targets of such operations, Anderson continued, are people who have significant political influence or access to high-ranking officials or sensitive information. And the Russians are not necessarily obvious spies. In fact, he said, it’s sometimes better that they aren’t.  
Foreign agents who conduct such operations, Anderson continued, “are often not trained intelligence officers” because their movements and contacts” can present a high risk of exposure.

>Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peace time, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.
Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United State corporations.
This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence-economic, political, even spiritual-is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.

>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.


>We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.",2023-01-19 19:11:05

"They did interfere though.

Indirectly, through hacking and releasing private data. And more directly, like the hacking of voter registries, the literal lists of who is allowed to vote. Oh, and the registry hacks happened after they stole the lists that the Democratic Party keeps on who is a good donor, who is a good voter, who is a likely voter, etc. And right after the Trump campaign handed the Russians lists of who strong Democratic voters are in specific swing districts and states. 

The big problem with the latter, is that we don't keep records of changes to our registries, so there's no evidence of the changes, beyond the espionage we were doing with the Netherlands into the Russian military who were conducting the hack. Which might be the most tinfoily-sounding sentence I've ever written. Thought there's also evidence in the form of a record increase in Provisional Ballot voting in specific swing districts across the country, which is notable because Provisional Ballots are what you cast if you're not on the actual voter registry, and often don't get counted unless there's a recount.",2023-01-19 19:00:39

"We don't need the senate in its current form because it's redundant and represent ""land getting a vote"".

In its previous/original form, it at least served some purpose because, since it wasn't directly elected, it represented *state governments* getting a vote. It's conceivable that state government might have different and valuable insight on how policies would work in practice, especially in modern times when so much of federal policy is intertwined with state policy. I'm not saying it's definitely a good idea, but just that, at least in that form, it brings more to the table than skewing the vote count so there is a real debate to be had. In that form, it brings different stakeholders to the table in congress and insulates senators from everyday politics moreso than positions that are directly voted. It also creates the capacity for more official collaboration between the state and federal government, while right now it's more back channels.

The metaphor I use is to imagine you're paying an architect to have a home built:

- In the current system, it's like for some decisions you and your spouse get a disproportionate vote compared to your kids (senate) and other decisions you all get an equal vote (house), but either way... all choices about the house are a vote from your family.
- In the original system: It's like some decisions you make with your contractor (senate) and others you make with your family (house). While giving the contractor a vote does feel like giving up some of your own autonomy, you are the one who picks the contractor and you can change the contractor. But the contractor might have insights about implementation challenges that you don't have, so it makes some sense to give them a vote when figuring out how things will be designed.",2023-01-20 06:19:30

"People losing critical thinking skills and falling for cheap tricks like buzzwords in legislation is by design.

In the past several years, there have been similar constitutional amendments in many states about voting. The one I'm familiar with in Colorado made a change from ""every citizen of the United States"" to ""only a citizen of the United States"" may vote in an election. These amendments were pushed by dark money organizations from out of state in many cases and were meant to drive the narrative that we let ""illegals"" vote and that change of wording changed absolutely nothing about the law.

There was a petition brought up before the last election that was something about ""Unlawful Murder of a Child"". To any sane person this name should sound a little suspicious, but in the modern political climate the name sounds good without the context of what they're doing. Basically they had some redundant stuff about harming kids with an abortion ban buried in the middle of it. Fortunately in Colorado, cooler heads tend to prevail. They were made to cut the nonsense out and make it clear that it was an  abortion ban by the committee that approves petitions. It didn't nearly get enough signatures to proceed.

So many ballot measures with misleading names come up, and I suspect that many of them pass on the misleading names alone.

"(I have posted this before but I think it is relevant here.) 

There is a super easy way to stop illegal immigration. It won't cost the government anything and no one has to go to jail. Use those vile civil asset forfeiture laws and go after the ill gotten gains of the people who benefit from the labor of illegal immigration.  If it’s perfectly okay to seize a car or a home or a business for the crime of a little bit of weed then apply the same standard to those who commit the crime of employing illegal workers.   

If an illegal immigrant is stocking shelves at a WalMart, seize the Walmart and auction it off. If an illegal immigrant is working construction, seize the construction site and the assets of the contractor and auction them off. Working at a nail salon? Seize the nail salon and auction it off. Mowing my neighbors yard? Seize his home and auction it off. Working as a nanny? Same thing. Seize the home and auction it off. If a farmer is using illegal immigration, seize the farm and auction it off.

Do that a few hundred times and there will be next to no illegal immigration because no one will come here because they will starve to death if they do. But doing that will require going after rich white people who break the law of the land by paying them instead of the poor brown people who break the law of the land by coming here.

**-OR we could go the sane, rational route.-**

We could be honest about this issue. We could address the fact that paying low wages is the ultimate end game of the businesses that exploit this labor.  We could hold them accountable for shutting out American workers in favor of cheaper and more exploitable labor.  We could acknowledge the fact that politicians use illegal immigration as a cheap dog whistle in order to pander and stoke the fears of their ignorant base.  We could also address the fact that there is a place in our society and our economy that the labor of illegal immigration fulfills.

Personally, I think if someone comes here willing to work, they should be given a Social Security number, a warm smile, a firm handshake welcoming them to America and the legal protections in the work place we all enjoy. There should be swift and fierce retribution to any employer who exploits them.

I work with illegal immigrants everyday.  They are good, hardworking, decent, moral, human beings that only want to provide a better life for themselves and their families.  

Between 1910 and 1925 All 4 of my grandparents walked off ships and started working. They along with all working people are what made America great.

I will add that no illegal immigrant has ever hurt me. The demographic group of people who have hurt me have mainly been rich, old, straight, so called Christian, white men in suits. Because of them The only affordable healthcare I can get is through my job. Because of them I have a shitty 401(k) instead of a pension. Because of them I don’t have a union and all the protections they secure. Because of them my 16-year-old may very well be in massive debt by the time he graduates college.  Because of them that same 16 year old will probably not be able to earn a true living wage once he does graduate college.  Because of those old rich white men ALL of our rights are slowly being eroded away one idiotic piece of legislation and one ridiculous court decision at a time.  If the old rich white men have their way the world will be a toxic waste dump in a few hundred years because why leave the world a better place for future generations when there is a few more cents to be added to the quarterly earnings per share statement now?  Old rich white men are the ones who are truly suppressing this country.

They know that the flow of undocumented immigration would quickly collapse if businesses had to face some real civil or criminal penalties for knowingly hiring these workers instead of just the workers themselves facing all the risk and penalties.

"Simple really.

An error from the Democrat's side is that they try to approach the Hispanic community as a monolithic one. Ie the belief they're all concerned about one thing ""Immigration"". Yes and no, yes they're concerned about immigration however it's about keeping other Hispanics out and themselves in.

Which brings us to point 2. Like everyone else in the world they are very much of the ""Fuck you, I got mine mentality."" And the GOP are very good at engaging in that on an individual level. When Hispanics hear the GOP talk crap about ""Mexicans"" they understand it as the crap talking being about actual Mexicans not how the GOP mean it ie Hispanics as a whole.

If the Democrats want to win the favor of Hispanics the approach needs to be  ""What can I give you, the individual that  is here?"" not ""The other side is so mean to you, and you care about immigration right? Vote for us.""

Bad move, especially with how prideful we are.

"In my experience as a hispanic person, it’s because a lot of the people that would vote Republican are repulsed by the idea of the socialist democrats going in and turning their home, which a lot of them have escaped to, into an authoritarian shithole that communist countries like Cuba and Venezuela plowed into the ground. You couldn’t sell a Venezuelan person on the idea of government handouts because that’s exactly what led to their country going to shit. The people who aren’t from these countries? They don’t want to end up like them and see them as some kind of cautionary tale. That’s where my dad falls into because he doesn’t want the government storming in and turning us into either of those countries and taking more of his hard earned money.

Which also leads me to the point where Republicans really nailed this messaging where being a rich, productive person gives you more inherent value than someone who can’t pull themselves by the bootstraps, and as people who faced the hardship of their home countries and then managed to move here, the whole hardworking messaging appeals to that. It’s also why there can be attitude of fuck undocumented immigrants because I went and did it the right hard way and they want to do it the wrong easy way and that’s bullshit for them.

"There didn’t used to be a lot of Venezuelans coming into US illegally. They’re not Central Americans.  The mass migration from Venezuela started when Venezuela and Russia got cozy. 

Same thing happened when Russia & Syria became allies. Suddenly, Europe was flooded with Syrian refugees. Remember when Putin sent  Syrians to Belarus and made Lukashenko put them at the Polish border? It was a provocation but Poland wasn’t having it.  Did you ask yourself at that time “How the hell did all those Syrians get to Belarus, of all places?” Good question. It’s not a country refugees strive to get to. They were sent there. 

It’s part of Putin’s active measures. You think it’s too crazy to be true? Putin is killing his own top people. He’s ruthless and he’s repeatedly said he hates the west. He’s funding NRA. He’s trying to start a Eurasian Union headed up by Russia. It’s a dream of his, google it.      

Putin is not fucking around. He believes the US & Europe are responsible for fall of USSR and he’s bent on revenge, using any and all measures to destabilize us, the same way he feels the US destabilized Eastern Europe and ultimately USSR. He’s trying to get back former USSR territories to rebuild Russian Empire. He’s influencing American politics and elections the same way CIA influenced other countries.   

What happened when Putin invaded Ukraine and US sent weapons and sided with Ukraine? All of a sudden, mass migration from Venezuela to the US border. Sure there were illegal immigrants coming from Venezuela before, but not mass migration like this. It’s the Syrian refugee flood to Europe all over again.  Putin destabilized EU with refugees enough for Brexit to happen.           

Of course it’s not just Putin. He’s a KGB guy with lots of GRU/FSB pals helping him out. They’re specialists in disruption. They’re waging a war outside of Ukraine, but the war out here isn’t using bombs. It’s using political, social, cultural and religious weapons. Social media was a godsend to these guys.

The kind of people who the republican party represents are such an extreme minority that it can be hard to fathom. They've succesfully convinced millions of people that they don't despise everybody who isn't an anglo-saxon white protestant, but that's exactly what they've done. And the thing is the republican party has literally always been like that. 

A lot of white Americans have forgotten their history. My family fought these people in Ireland and fled them in Italy. My existence is the product of refugees. When they came to America they were shoved into tenement housing and worked to near death by the capitalist class and ethnic hierarchy, they fought and died in their wars, and only by historical accident were they able to scratch up something other then poverty for their children. 

That story is not dissimilar from millions of other Americans, though you would not know this by talking to them. You'd think they were all right off the Mayflower. That's the great irony, the people who oppressed our ancestors now convince their descendants there's no difference between us and them. But there is, I'm a product of the European diaspora and an American proletariat. Republicans are the same group of people who historically were making money investing in the slave trade and killing natives in the name of land speculation.

I watched that stream and it was legitimately good. Disguised Toast and Hasanabi really opened her up to the community for a new form of outreach. Good on Hasan's mods pulling double duty for her chat too. They did a solid job and AOC can go back for similar get out the vote campaigns knowing how effective the viewership and interactions can be.

I listened to like 5 minutes of the Desantis thing. Ever wondered what a bunch of angry divorced Dads 69ing each other would sound like. That’s what it was and Ron Desantis reading from a script about the woke mind virus and constantly contradicting himself.

What does that even mean?,2023-05-25 18:34:47
"I asked chatGPT-4 to figure out what Trump mean by this tweet I thought it was interesting: 
In interpreting this statement by former President Trump, it's important to remember that he has a distinct style of communication, often characterized by hyperbole, innuendo, and a very unique way of presenting his point of view.

Given that context, this statement can be understood in the following way:

""Rob,”: This might be a purposeful or accidental misnaming of Ron DeSantis. Trump has been known to purposefully misname his political opponents as a way of belittling them.
""My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working (TRUTH!), yours does not!"": This seems to be a metaphorical statement. The 'red button' often represents power, specifically nuclear power, as it's colloquially used to refer to the control a President would have over nuclear weapons. In this context, it's likely a metaphor for influence or political power. He's essentially asserting that he still has more influence, power, or relevancy than DeSantis.
""(per my conversation with Kim Jung Un, of North Korea, soon to become my friend!)"": This is a reference to Trump's previous interactions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump's meetings with Kim were a controversial part of his foreign policy. By invoking this, he might be highlighting his ability to engage with controversial international figures, or asserting that his foreign policy was stronger.
All in all, this statement appears to be a criticism or challenge to Ron DeSantis, framed in Trump's unique style. Trump is implying that despite DeSantis's Presidential campaign launch, he believes his own political influence and experience remain superior.",2023-05-25 18:52:36
That's some weak shit.,2023-05-25 14:00:25
Stupidity in that statement aside… what if Don and Ron try to out fascist each other? Trump may want to start looking for other sanctuary states. He may find Mar-a-lago condemned and forfeited to the state for… reasons,2023-05-25 15:23:09
"See, posts like that are why the idea of Donald Trump holding onto classified documents is so bad. Sure, Joe Biden shouldn't have still had his, but at least he wasn't actively talking about how he was attempting to befriend heads of state of nations we're on extremely bad terms with and treating them like they're the coolest people on earth. If I did this kind of shit while having an active security clearance I'd be facing a sedition hearing faster than Rob DeSantis making a clapback at Disney. It's insane to me this crazy world we live in now.",2023-05-25 15:25:09
What does that even mean??,2023-05-25 17:17:51
"one of the all time greatest trump tweets TBH. right up there with the ""look at this photograph"" tweet.",2023-05-25 21:15:15
"What an insane bit of gibberish to post when you’re trying to deliver a sick burn to a rival. Keep on fucking message, Don!

It’s honestly crazy to me that we live in a world where Trump, fending off his handlers who must want to tackle him to take away his phone, posts bananas shit like this and his base is emphatically like, “Yes! This man gets us!!”

People are curious to see if she wins and how good she is at lying.  People just like spectating the game, because its a fun game both for playing and watching.

Meanwhile, Ron DeSantis said ""I'm going to appear on Twitter and say that I'm running for President"" which... okay?  We all knew you were running.  Now we don't even need to hear the announcement because you just announced your announcement.  The *only* reason to watch the Twitter feed is to catch him in a live Fumble-the-Ball moment.  And even then, you're going to have more fun watching the outtakes and memes after the fact, because waiting 5 minutes for Elon Musk to turn the machines off and turn them back on again isn't nearly as much fun as watching some TikTok-er with tig bitties do rifs over the top of Yakkaty Saks while the video plays behind her.

"It would ruin her mental health. The amount of hate you get online if you vocally support leftist ideals is *incredible*. You would think being a congressperson is worse, but that ignores how insanely easy it is to get direct access to a person on twitch. Haters while you try to live broadcast are a completely different beast than haters in your DMs.

...and that's without talking about how women in particular are treated online, in gaming spaces, and on twitch specifically. I've heard multiple massive male twitch streamers say, ""I can't believe how much harassment all of my female streamer friends with a quarter of my audience get. The intensity and amount of stalkers is actually unbelievable.""

Finally, there are all of the extremely deranged right wing people who are too nuts to actually interact with people irl anymore and spent most of their time online trying to find the best possible way to ""trigger the libs"" and literally the highlight of their month is when their community organizes a harassment campaign against someone on the left.

AOC is best where she is.

"Truly. Reading these and the other top posts, it seems like no one is engaging critically with the content of the announcement… sure the headline is that the tech failed, but did no one actually listen to them in the Space when it got rolling? He’s not fucking around. 

He claimed that Florida is #1 in education and I was like “no way” .. sure enough, behold [US education rankings](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education) . Like where tf did that come from y’all? He also is much more well-spoken than Donald, and “debunked” the book ban ( I personally know he’s a fascist but he was eloquent enough to bamboozle my Right-curious younger brother, which is why I’m making this post tbh).. made other claims like saying Florida is a top-growing state in black-owned businesses, etc. He said also that he is in favor of leaving in lessons about history like slavery, reconstruction, civil rights. It’s true many Americans are sick of being told that whiteness makes you inherently racist or harmful (that has been in general a very unfortunate misread of CRT) and he is someone that is making sense to them, as he declared war on the “woke mind virus.” 

Like you said, I wouldn’t underestimate the amount of people who are flocking to this guy, especially in this vacuum of other viable candidates. In the instance of this announcement and Q&A, I wish there were more serious engagement with and fact-checking of the claims made by him instead of  brushing it off and assuming everyone thinks he’s a fascist idiot.",2023-05-25 17:50:59

"There are a ton of things that can go wrong over time, and I really don't know the technology Twitter uses in the back end, but in a generic company example, here are some things I'd expect to see falling apart.  

&#x200B;

* The load balancing systems are sending traffic to servers that are performing at 50%, perhaps due to something stupid like Windows Update running in the background, possibly a backup job, etc.    Nobody is paying attention to the load balancers.
* Those same load balancers are sending traffic to servers that are still responding to shit like port 80/443, but in reality the web application in the back end is crashed.   All those users that got sent to those servers get a broken app.  Again, nobody is paying attention to the load balancers.
* When the 4th Quarter Failover Test was performed, nobody noticed that traffic never rerouted itself back to the desired paths, and for some fucked up reason ALL of our traffic is routing out the backup site in goddam Jersey.   That site only has a 1GB backup circuit!
* Nobody has checked the Data Center Facilities console in awhile, and didn't notice that two of the chillers are down.   When all those folks started hammering on our application, servers heated up and started crashing.   
* Hey, did anyone notice that when you fired Network Team A, Network Team B set a bunch of random transport circuits to Half Duplex, knowing they'd be shitcanned soon too?
* Hey, you know that SAN that needs to have it's cache manually flushed every three months or so or it stops working?  LOL ya fired the dude who was responsible for that.
* Fuck, the load balancer crashed again.   The password in LastPass isn't right... who knows it?  Oh yeah, we fired him.
* Hey Dev Team, you know that last update you pushed that helped stability in mass events like a presidential campaign announcement?  Did that ever make it to live?  No?  Oh, we fired the team that does that.

&#x200B;

And if anyone says ""oh, but Twitter has a lot of money, they wouldn't have a shoddy infrastrucutre"" all I can say to that is lol \*EVERY\* large corporation has skeletons in their closet.

The innocent person will then be more likely to defend you and claim you're innocent, too, which lets you throw suspicion off yourself.

Disguised Toast is a very well known Among Us streamer, and was part of the group AOC played with. He's also very good at the game, as both a civilian and as a killer. (He's actually better, imo, at being a civilian and figuring out the killers, but he's pretty entertaining in any role.) In one of the meetings, where he was a killer, he was accused of marinating AOC because he was hanging around her. He insisted he wasn't, but he was lying.

"Random anecdote, but back in 2010, I went to school in Fitchburg, Mass. for my freshman year of high school. I lived with my (not so great) grandparents, and the meal that was given to me at school by the Mass. school system was basically my meal of the whole day. I got a salad wrap with soup. Nothing amazing in flavor but it was healthy and filled me up.

Jump one year later, I move back to Rhode Island with my parents. The food that was given to me at that terrible school was like something I would cook up in my air fryer at 3am high as balls. Unlike my grandparents, fortunately for me, my parents were actually interested in fucking feeding me, so I did not have to rely on raggedy chicken patty sandwiches and stringy pizza slices. And those two were the biggest servings you could have. 

I guess what I wanted to say in this word avalanche was that Mass. has always, at least in my experience, looked out for me, the needy kid that was hungry with no food. And I applaud the Mass. government for continuing to improve even more.",2023-08-13 18:07:48

These organizations require that people have access to them, and even know they exist. This then excludes marginalized communities that don't have enough resources to do it among themselves. As I mentioned, it also requires a person be physically able to access this private distribution. With SNAP, it just shows up on the card, so once you sign up, the government can provide assistance to people regardless of all that.

every NY building that trump org manages (not owns)    
is at this moment seeking a new management company    
as after oct'2nd it can not risk being managed by an    
unlicensed nyc/s company, and/or fraudulent one.    

Trump is the management company for Trump Tower    
however he owns a minority of it, so if the condo    
shareholders vote to change managers and they have to,    
not only will they lose that contract, but shareholders    
could vote to remove Trump's name from the building.    

this could all happen starting next week,    
as waiting for appeal only matters to the penalties    
he will ultimately have to pay, NOT the business license  
which as of oct'2 will be revoked and unlikely to be reinstated.  

a bigger question is what will trumps over leveraged    
loan holders do... who could foreclose and call some debt  
since a bank can't very well lend to an unlicensed business,   
nor one (after appeal) convicted of tort fraud.  any NY vendor    
or employee of trump's will be left holding the bag if trump   
is financing his AP & PR - which he most likely is doing.  
they will have to wait years till many assets are liquidated  
for them to get paid whatever trump owes them, so if you  
work for trump in NYC/S i'd advise you to resign asap,    
and don't expect to see severance, and make sure that    
any benefits you paid into, keep getting paid - by YOU,

And one is old and has been charged with 91 felonies.""

Democrats have continuously refused to do what voters ask of them, and the little they have done they aren't even campaigning on, they're just trying to browbeat voters into voting against Trump. People are very clear that they're tired of out-of-touch elderly candidates, too.


Look, there's no way in hell I'm voting for Trump or third party come November. But the reality is that Biden is a terrible President who's values do not align with mine. The truth is also that he is emblematic of the problems I and many other Dems have with the party. The least Clinton and other Dems can do is not treat voters like recalcitrant children because they are voting their conscience and aren't cowtowing to a Democratic party who is ultimately still conservative and not the bastion of liberal (let alone leftist) politics it pretends to be. Being nasty and condescending and dismissive to voters will never work, and it certainly won't work for voters who aren't just children throwing a tantrum, but have real concerns that are not being addressed (i.e. all of them).",2024-04-03 08:27:48

Trump was the first president in decades to stop supporting a two-state solution. All of the presidents before him were actually extremely Pro-Palestine. 

Trump tried to make some deal by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, And then buying the Palestinians off with Qatari aid. 

Then Netanyahu announce that he was going to annex half the West Bank. And several Arab states were like, ""Don't do that and we will normalize relations with you."" 

He agreed, But the result was that the Palestinians got completely left out of the discussion. They felt hopeless. This led to the conflict exploding so that people actually pay attention to them again. 

But like you can't talk about any of this in most forums due to the emotional rage. People act like the US government endorses the slaughter. 

We're delivering hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to the Palestinians right now. We are pushing Isreal for a ceasefire, and promising we well help them secure their borders so they don't feel threatened.

"As someone looking in on the USA from Europe this is completely balloney to me. You have a president that is actively pushing through a major economic transformation, greatly expands the social safety net, slashes drone warfare almost entirely (after 3 presidents succesively expanding it), finally has the guts to go out of a completely directionless occupation and the list goes on - and that guy you call ""not the worst""? I give you, I did have very low expectations for Biden and you can probably find old reddit posts of me stating just that if you wanted to but after 3 years in office he's possibly the only half decent US president in his own fucking lifetime, that is since FDR. 

Granted Biden isn't great but US presidents for the last 80 years have been pretty consistently relatively shitty. I mean how else do you think it became the only OECD country without universal healthcare? How else did the infrastructure become so shitty? How else do you think the status quo is still that the US will invade Den Haag if they ever take Americans to court? How else are you in a situation where half of the voting population seems to want fascism? If the USA didn't half a butload of natural ressources and the world reserve currency it truly makes you wonder how hard it would crash because in so many ways it's so fundamentally poorly organized.

This isn't to say the USA misfires at everything but a lot of the fundamentals are just comparatively really bad and seem to be set up for failure once the current advantages of the USA diminish. If I was governing the USA I would be scrambling to improve these things as fast as I could. 

I can also outline where it cracked, Watergate. Up until and including Nixon the USA was really in a lot of the ways far ahead of the curve and a very progressive country. The primary reason I do not look too fondly on people like Eisenhower, Kennedy, LBJ and co is the very fucked up foreign policy but domestically the direction was quite decent and I guess you could call Biden the best since LBJ if you think that Vietnam wasn't so bad afterall or since Eisenhower if you think toppling Mossadegh was just whatever (both of which I disagree with). However something must have completely crushed the entire country with Watergate because man, the post Watergate boys just suck so bad and Biden is kind of ironically a breath of fresh air, maybe because he came into Senate before Watergate and still remembers that you can also go forward instead of constantly going backwards or stepping on the same spot.

I don't want to praise him too much because as a socialist he's still pretty far from what I would hope for but as I previously stated the bar for US presidents is generally extremely low and you should be happy with Biden because the last 50 years indicate that it can only get worse.",2024-04-03 13:46:05

"They know it’s a real possibility that it will swing the election to Trump. They also know that Trump would be worse for Palestinians than Biden. But they believe that it’s what they must do to force the Democratic Party to meet their demands, which I believe is a complete stop to any funding/aid sent to Israel. 

But if they get what they want: a complete change in the Democratic Party platform with regard to Israel at the cost of a Trump presidency, either they don’t understand or don’t care that the change in policy won’t mean shit considering the democrats will be out of power and unable to change anything for at least the next four years. I don’t think nuance and critical thinking is their thing.

I also expect to receive some “Reddit Cares” messages for this post, as they also like to troll with abusing that feature with any posts on the subject that don’t support their own.

Edit: unsurprisingly, there are some who are reading this post as a full-throated endorsement of Israel, which it isn’t. The post was attempting to summarize the position of those who have voted uncommitted in the primaries and have threatened to either abstain or vote for someone other than Biden due to the administration’s policy on Israel. I don’t think that I’m wrong in my summary: that they generally recognize it might get Trump elected again and that Trump would likely be even more pro-Israel than Biden. But it *is* possible to oppose how Israel has handled their response to the 10/7 terrorist attacks while also recognizing that Trump would be both worse for the conflict and an existential threat to our democracy.",2024-04-03 05:44:46
"It feels like an op from the right. Palestinians have been going through horrific shit for *how long*?

Like if Trump started bombing migrants nearing the southern border and our allies were unable to stop him, would other world leaders get this response from their citizens for failing to stop it?

Now you’ve got leftists forming up with right wing propagandists like Jackson Hinkle because they “agree” with each other, and totally not because the grifters are using the tragedy to gain a wider audience. Ceasefire protests go after Democratic members instead of the entirety of the right, who’d rather see Gaza turned into a Trump oceanfront resort complex before any peaceful resolution. They don’t even understand the politics they’re railing against, it’s like they just started paying attention.

I have my issues with how the US has responded, and I want peace immediately, but the lack of nuance from people is getting ridiculous. They won’t pose a threat to the election, but they’ve revealed themselves as wholly unserious reactionaries using carnage as an excuse to threaten “the empire of the United States”.

But to *staunchly* say you won’t vote for him in the general is insane; how many marginalized people had to suck it up and vote for racists, bigots, misogynists, war criminals etc throughout our country’s history? If they graded on the same rubric, nobody would’ve ever fucking voted at all. Even in recent history, both Obama and Hillary didn’t publicly support gay marriage in their ‘08 campaigns; should LGBTQ people have just not voted for them? Should black people not have voted for FDR because he wasn’t pushing strongly for civil rights/equality? 

Don’t get me wrong; I’m livid with Biden/Dems for their support of Israel and their handling of both this and Covid. They’ve ceded any moral authority and a lot of their words ring hollow for me because of what I’ve seen them either tolerate or outright support.

Then the right wing grifters caught onto this and realized it was an opportunity for them to get in front of a large audience of primarily impressionable young men, and they did their best to be on his show as often as possible.

"He did more than just say that...

He threw the Obama era precision strikes out the window, and ordered the carpet bombing of Raqqa. A 5,000 year old city reduced to dust in a manner not seen since WWII. Then he had the gall to declare total victory over ISIS. Which we know with current events, couldn't be farther from the truth.

The videos of the city after the bombing campaign were absolutely surreal. It's just miles of rubble. It looked not unlike Hiroshima or Dresden after the fire bombings.

There was a top post yesterday about how ISIS destroyed ancient sites by hand, but no mention of how a single narcissist gave the order to eviscerate an entire ancient city in a half-baked shortcut to killing an entire ideology. That's just how he thinks. You can apparently carpet bomb ideas and nuke hurricanes into submission. Why didn't anyone else think of that?? 🤦

So sad it got brushed under the rug with his 10,000 other escalating transgressions. Any other president, it would have been a defining moment, not to mention, war crime for their administration. 

He didn't defeat ISIS, he played right into their hands, bringing indiscriminate wholesale slaughter to their doorstep with US bombs. Now they can point to the ruins as de facto proof the western world has every intention of erasing the Islamic Middle East off the face of planet. It's the perfect recruitment tool, paid for in full by American taxpayer dollars and innocent blood.

It was an unmitigated disaster. The fallout of which will be felt for decades to come. It blows my mind it doesn't even register on people's radars when discussing Trump's endless follys.

These claims have circulated for years on message boards, in books like Peter Blecha’s Taboo Tunes: A History of Banned Bands & Censored Songs, and on Wikipedia. And the answer is both yes, and no. Jazz from Hell did not get the familiar “Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics” label, nor was it specifically targeted by Gore’s organization.

>The album was, however, stickered in 1990—notes Dave Thompson’s The Music Lover’s Guide to Record Collecting—by “the Pacific Northwest chain of Fred Meyer department stores,” who gave it “the retailer’s own ‘Explicit Lyrics’ warning, despite the fact that the album was wholly instrumental.” This is likely due to the word “hell” and the title of the song “G-Spot Tornado.” So it may be fair to say that Zappa’s Jazz from Hell is the only fully instrumental album to receive an “Explicit Lyrics” warning, inspired by, if not directly ordered by, the PMRC.",2023-08-28 14:56:16

"Conservatives believe that women seek to entrap men. They think that women lure men into sex, using ""feminine wiles"" like dressing slutty. Then they say that they were raped, with the objective of extorting men into marriage or money, or simply punishing men for being male.

The key to this strategy is consent - lying about how they didn't want sex. And they think that Democrats are in on the scam because... well, because Democrats hate Republicans and hate men. The End.

Consider the beliefs that this notion supports:

* ""High-value"" men with a lot of money are systematically targeted by weaker individuals to tear them down.

* Women and ""beta"" men are conspiring against ""alpha"" men primarily because of their identity.

* The men in these scenarios are helpless victims, acting on their natural instincts and easily manipulated into sex, and are blameless for their actions.

In other words, it perfectly supports the conservative world view of constant victimhood, of ""makers"" vs. ""takers,"" and the dehumanization of women into manipulative creatures who deserve whatever men might otherwise inflict on them. It certainly explains why conservatives have wholly absorbed the redpill movement.",2023-08-28 19:44:02

"Rape culture has always relied on two parallel definitions of rape existing side by side. One is a straightforward matter of consent. The other is a heteronormative concept of controlling women's sexuality.

Even in liberal California, it was only about a decade ago that people realized a loophole in state law: it's rape if a man tricks a woman into having sex by impersonating her husband in the dark, but only if he pretends to be her husband. 

A case in the Santa Barbara area involved a man who pretended to be a woman's boyfriend. And he had a strong defense in court by the plain language of the law. Usually the attitude behind that statute is less formal: once a woman consents to sex with anyone other than her husband, she forfeits the protection of the law from sexual assault.",2023-08-28 19:18:36

However, when someone wants to abolish gender roles, race, class, etc. this literally is the destruction of the interacting cogs of society to them. They don't really care if their own freedoms get restricted, either, because they are generally content with having a place in society with clearly defined duties. Destroying a role based society and having to figure their life out for themselves can genuinely be a terrifying idea for them. It's particularly bad if there's no guaranteed spots for everyone and people can fall out and become homeless and such. They see this as a result of social roles degenerating.

“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

One of the cases being cited to back the court's decision and push back against Trump's, CRSCC's arguments is [Hassan v. Colorado](https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/01018907241.pdf) (2012).

>""Moreover, several courts have expressly upheld states’ ability to exclude constitutionally ineligible candidates from their presidential ballots. See... Hassan v. Colorado, 495 F. App’x 947, 948–49 (10th Cir. 2012)...""  
...  
>  
>""As then-Judge Gorsuch recognized in Hassan, it is 'a state’s legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of the political process” that “permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.' ""  
...  
>  
>""Where a candidate does not submit (or cannot comply with) the required attestations on the statement of intent form, the Secretary cannot list the candidate on the ballot. See Hassan v. Colorado...""  
...  
>  
>""Nor are we persuaded by President Trump’s assertion that Section Three does not bar him from running for or being elected to office because Section Three bars individuals only from holding office. Hassan specifically rejected any such distinction... There, the candidate argued that even if Article II “properly holds him ineligible to assume the office of president,” Colorado could not 'deny him a place on the ballot.' The Hassan panel concluded otherwise.

Basically this dude who's a naturalized citizen wanted to run for the office of the presidency but, as we know, the constitution forbids this and only allows natural-born citizens. Blah blah, he's informed he's ineligible and argues that this violates his rights under various clauses of the 14th amendment. Court rules against him concluding that the rights granted under the 14th do not invalidate Art. II of the Constitution (which includes qualifications for the office).

Anyway, the ruling isn't the most interesting part.. it's the fact that it was affirmed by Neil Gorsuch while he was appointed to the Tenth Circuit, which has jurisdiction over Colorado as well as being based/headquartered there. From his/their ruling:

>But, as the magistrate judge’s opinion makes clear and we expressly reaffirm here, a state’s legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of the political process permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.

This is the type of word-twisting, semantics bullshit I pulled out of my ass whenever I was on the losing side in my HS debate club.

"A conviction may not be required if you assume the word ""conviction"" was left out of that clause on purpose.

It says ""shall have engaged in insurrection"", rather than convicted of insurrection. That might mean that in this particular case, the authors didn't care to make a distinction because the word ""conviction"" appears in many other areas in the constitution.

If this clause was written with the intention of disqualifying confederate officers from serving in the Union government, then perhaps they realized that they wouldn't/couldn't have secured convictions for all those confederates before new elections.

Just guessing though.",2023-12-19 21:28:39
"Let's be honest, this is why we've had debates without Trump even when all the candidates on stage are down by 40+ points in the polls.

>Here, the Election Code limits presidential primary ballot access to only qualified candidates. Such a restriction is an “eminently reasonable” regulation that does not severely burden CRSCC’s [Colorado Republican State Central Committee] associational rights. To hold otherwise would permit political parties to disregard the requirements of the law and the Constitution whenever they decide, as a matter of “political expression” or “political choice,” that those requirements do not apply.

"Posted this as a reply, think it merits some discussion on application in modern age v Reconstruction era. Had a great talk with my brother(lawyer) about this and he sent me the following:

>""No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a two-thirds vote of each House, remove such disability.""

The application of Section 3 does not require a criminal conviction for insurrection. This was the case when the provision was enforced during Reconstruction. The standard for determining whether someone had ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" was based on whether they performed an ""overt and voluntary act, done with the intent of aiding or furthering the common unlawful purpose."" This could include acts of insurrectionist speech that incited others to engage in rebellion.",2023-12-19 19:30:10

Republicans suddenly about to be strongly against states’ rights,2023-12-19 16:39:35
"Some of ya'll need to actually read the amendment, so here's the relevant text from the 14th amendment:

>**Section 3**. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

Since he was literally there and contributed to the incitement of the mob to disturb the peaceful transfer of power through his charged speech and later inaction, was part of plots to use fake electors perform a coup of the duly elected government, and continues to undermine the integrity of the election with lies and conspiracies, it's pretty easy to conclude he engaged in the insurrection and/or rebellion on Jan 6 (whether or not he masterminded it is a matter for his other trials -- he definitely ***engaged*** in it).

The only thing left was whether or not he needed to be convicted first, which the court just ruled that it does not say he needs to have been convicted of a crime, only engaged in insurrection or rebellion.

Also...to all the ""sets a bad precedent!"" people here, it sets the precedent that a candidate can be blocked from the ballot when he does exactly what Trump is doing:  undermining our democratic process.  This is a good...no...great thing.  It still took a court to decide this -- it wasn't a political process, but a legal one.",2023-12-19 17:08:56

"So from what I can tell regarding how these bids have gone from a bit of Googling:

- 8-14-23: New Hampshire’s top election official said he will not invoke an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to block Trump from appearing on ballots in the state, which will hold the first Republican presidential primary next year.

- 8-31-23: Advocacy group Free Speech For People, sent letters to election officials in Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and New Mexico, asking them to use their authority to exclude Trump from the ballots.

- 10-02-23: **The Supreme Court has declined to hear a case arguing Trump is disqualified from making any 2024 ballots because of his alleged role in the January 6 Capitol riot.**

- 10-05-23: Arizona's Sectary of State Fontes announced in an interview on Fox 10 Phoenix that his hands are tied by Arizona law (regarding Trump’s legal eligibility for the ballot). State law directs the secretary of state to certify candidates who both file to appear on the ballot in Arizona 100 days before the presidential preference election and were approved for the ballots of at least two other states.

- 10-20-23: A federal judge in New Hampshire heard arguments in a lawsuit aimed at keeping Trump off the first-in-the-nation ballot. John Anthony Castro has filed 27 federal lawsuits across the country, including in New Hampshire, challenging Trump's eligibility to run under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

- 10-30-23: A federal judge in New Hampshire has dismissed a lawsuit filed by John Anthony Castro that sought to remove Trump’s name from the 2024 New Hampshire primary ballot.

- 11-08-23: **Minnesota's Supreme Court ruled Trump can remain on the GOP primary ballot but did not address his eligibility for the general election ballot.**

- 11-14-23: A Michigan judge dismissed a lawsuit that tried to use the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” to remove Donald Trump from the state’s 2024 ballot. The judge separately ruled that Michigan’s secretary of state doesn’t have the power under state law to determine the former president’s eligibility for office based on the 14th Amendment. **Days later voters in Michigan appealed the decision and are seeking immediate review by the Michigan Supreme Court.** 

- 11-17-23: In Colorado, a state court judge in Denver said in a ruling that Section 3 does not apply to Trump and ordered him to be placed on the presidential primary ballot. Days later there was an appeal asking the state supreme court to review the decision. Their appeal challenges the trial court's ruling that Section 3 does not cover the president.

- 12-05-23: A federal court in Arizona dismissed a lawsuit that argued Trump should be disqualified from appearing on the state's ballot next year on constitutional grounds.

- 12-06-23: **The Michigan Supreme Court refused to immediately hear an appeal of a lower court’s ruling that would allow Trump’s name to be on the state’s presidential primary ballot.** The state Supreme Court said the case should remain before the state court of appeals, and not immediately move to Michigan’s highest court as a liberal group had requested.

- 12-19-23: **Colorado's Supreme Court removed Trump from the state’s 2024 ballot, ruling that he isn’t an eligible presidential candidate because of the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.” This decision will likely be appealed.**",2023-12-19 15:53:24

- They rule Trump is disqualified nationwide in basic agreement with the reasons the Colorado SC found. I know many want this but I think the chances are realistically not great given the composition of the court. On the other hand, it’s likely the most legally sound ruling. 
- They rule to “leave it to the states” - but the implications of that are very messy, and probably not legally warranted given 14A is part of the federal constitution.
- They punt on it by saying the states have no authority to rule on eligibility in primaries. This has already been ruled by at least one state court. I think this is unlikely because Trump will clearly be the nominee - it’s just going to boomerang back.
- They rule that the trigger for 14A can only be a judicial conviction that confirms Trump engaged in insurrection.

Reading through the opinion, the core part of it ( overturning the notion that the president is not an officer of the United States) leans heavily on the analysis by Baude and Paulsen, the two Federalist society law professors that wrote a definitive, recent paper on article 3:
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4532751

(there's long sections in there to support the ideas that art. 3 is self executing, that the president is an office holder, and that freedom of speech is not a viable defense.  It's worth a read)

By quoting Gorsuch, they are putting him in a bit of a bind. If he is to be internally consistent, he should affirm the SCCO ruling.

Not to mention that a majority of the conservatives (if not all?) are FedSoc members, so the conclusions of Baude and Paulsen should carry some weight with them.

Weed, they want to butcher the tax setup at the very least and take a chunk from the current tax setup (issue 2/legalizing MJ is in effect) and put that money towards law enforcement and police training when it comes to cannabis and instead of the tax money being made from recreational going back into the area with the dispensary they want it to go all over the state. They also want to do a limit on product potency that really isn't worth change for concentrates. They want to allow areas to basically say screw the state constitution and allow weed to be illegal in places the head of the area doesn't want it to be legal in. 

Something is seriously fucked up in Ohio's Senate.


Edit for some clarification: abortion and weed are two things we voted to legalize a few months ago. Being a MMJ user I was more invested in it but if I'm remembering right we gathered signatures to get them on the ballot as well. Abortion/issue 1 also goes into contraceptives like birth control.

A: No.  Q: Do you agree that Biden is corrupt and needs to removed from office? A:  No.  Q: Who is more mentally stable and fit to serve as president? A: Biden.

Better narrative:

When democrats ran Biden instead of Clinton their share of the 2020 election went up 3%, not only securing the popular vote a second time, but the electoral college vote as well. 

In 2020 Trump did increase in votes by raw numbers, because more Americans participated vs 2016. Trump’s increase was 0.3%.


Since 2020 GOP/MAGA has lost *many* elections, failed to actualize a Red Wave in 2022, and barely holds onto the House of Representatives. 

The Republican Party apparatus is managed by poor leaders, and is running out of money while Donald Trump struggles to capitalize on his revenge messaging.

 No new voter demographics are embracing his message. That’s key. In addition to everything else, his “incumbency” isn’t pulling votes away from Biden’s coalition.  

So unlike 2016, there is no bloc of voters Trump can pull. He would have already done so and defeated Biden. Rather Biden’s ability to pull in people away from Trump and into the process was a one-way street. The conditions of 2020 haven’t evolved. ",2024-03-11 12:04:19

For decades both parties have flirted with this group on the fringes, but have never really made a direct appeal to them because they knew they were nuts and could destroy a party.  And since they don't represent a coherent value system to build policy and messaging around they don't make for a durable coalition unless you can keep them entertained.

Trump (Bannon, actually) recognized that capturing this group with a personality cult would be an incredibly powerful force politically, but it's a devil's bargain: the rest of the political world finds them repulsive so they tend to drive away the old core constituencies, and when the energy and drama eventually runs out they get bored and don't bother voting.",2024-03-11 11:25:47

"> I don’t vote harder or less hard depending on the polls

You are not the target of these comments then.  Unfortunately there’s a huge % of people who really *do* base their decision on the likelihood of winning.  It’s stupid but true.  On Election Day, overconfident people will just assume their guy will win anyway, so it’s okay if they “didn’t have time” to go vote.  Pessimistic people will decide it’s doomed anyway so why bother.  This effect is x10 if they’ve gotten home and already set their stuff down already, before realizing “shit I forgot to go vote… ah well.”

It’s not logical to you or me, but it is to them.  Hell, when I was a field organizer for a caucus many many years ago, for a candidate that was in 3rd+ place.  TONS of people told me they liked him the best, but wouldn’t vote for him, again *in the caucus* mind you not the general, because “he’s probably not going to beat the other 2.”   Endless frustration.  People actually think that if your guy loses, you “wasted your vote.”  Like, you *dumb motherfuckers*, this isn’t a game show where you win something for guessing correctly! 

So that’s why yes we *do* need to motivate people as though their vote is the difference.",2024-03-11 10:18:17

It's when he does press briefings or 1 on 1 interviews is where he slows down.  Those settings is where he gives long pauses, closes his eyes and thinks carefully of his next answer almost to the point where you think he fell asleep lol.

Hes their pied piper for all the little rat bastard voters. But the catch is he has to win. Hes never won the popular vote. He lost 2020 which was big bc he had the inside track.

Even fumbling covid that badly he had all those people on the inside trying to overturn it and he still lost. Then all the court losses. Then not coming through on proving the election was stolen.

Not being reinstalled. Losing all the legals cases so far. Yeah his supporters dont care but the GOP wants someone who can win. And Trump hasnt had a win since 2016. And that was under dubious circumstances that has left a cloud over their head.

I think theyve relegated themselves to the fact Trumps going to lose. Theyre hoping something happens that changes that but if its on the level Trump is headed towards another loss.

That would be two presidential campaign losses in 4 years. Hes already lost quite a bit of his mojo. Another loss like that would kill any confidence the GOP has left in him.

And then their problem is going to be moving on when their base has been taken over by Trump. Theyve screwed themselves. Thats why theyre desperate to take this election any way they can. They get back in power nothing matters.

Trump has also proven that, as long as he is alive, we will never see another GOP candidate who he won't actively attack and undercut at every opportunity because it helps stoke his own ego.  He is physically incapable of putting the ""greater good"" (even when it's pure evil) above his own desires, he would rather see the GOP never take the White House again than throw his support behind another person. 

Even without the extremist MAGA section, this is the GOP we're talking about here.  No woman had *ever* won a GOP primary in any state in American history until Nikki Haley won a extremely blue state that would never actually go her way in an actual presidential election.  There have been rumblings since McCain lost that the GOP would start pushing Hispanic candidates to adapt to the changing demographics of the nation (and to fool idiot Democrats into thinking the party has progressed), and their voters resoundingly reject every single one of them when they hit the national stage and open their mouths.  All of the white men they start to push end up stumbling and admitting to (or openly bragging about) being white Christian nationalists on social media, which is great for gaining MAGA support but it hardly paints them as more politically savvy than Trump. 

Obviously no one can predict the future and I'm no exception, but (assuming Trump loses 2024) unless they stumble on some new, unknown candidate like a MAGA Obama who has a shred of bipartisan appeal, no prior felonies and doesn't repel voters every time they speak, I think the people pulling the strings (and funding the cause) will eventually consider MAGA to be a failed experiment like they did with the Tea Party. The nation isn't becoming more white, male, hetero, or Christian, *eventually* they're going to figure out that telling the majority of adult Americans that they would rather see us dead than give a single inch is a losing strategy.",2024-03-11 15:42:23

"I'm not sure that rebuilding the GOP will fix this -- I mean, they'd just be replaced by somebody else who will just be them in different clothing.

For starters, we need to fix all these damn loopholes that can be used to steal the election.  Gerrymandering definitely needs to be done away with, that'll help with the House, but the Electoral College itself has a bunch of issues too, and the best option would be to do away with it entirely, but that's going to be a hard thing to sell politically.  

But if our answer is to simply ""never let the GOP come into power again"" ... well, that's going to fail, sooner or later.  It's a good short-term step, but long term, we need to fix this stuff.  I mean, the EC made the popular vote loser into the winner in 2000 and 2016, that's huge by itself, but now the GOP is laser-focused on finding cracks in everything to make sure they win whatever they can, and I don't think even ""destroying and rebuilding"" them will fix that.",2024-03-11 13:34:11

As for DeSantis, I think he really blew it running in 2024, since it just set him to fail against Trump. He's also done himself no favors with Florida Republicans either though, so maybe he couldn't have survived till 2028 without the governorship to lean on.
