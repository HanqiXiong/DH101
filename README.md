# Abstract
This project investigates the sentiment expressed in three political subreddits: r/politics, r/conservative, and r/liberal. Using data collected from January 2023 to June 2024, we applied sentiment analysis techniques to understand the emotional tone and discourse within these communities. By employing the VADER sentiment analysis tool and visualizing the results with Seaborn, we revealed significant differences in sentiment across the subreddits, reflecting their distinct ideological leanings. This research provides valuable insights into online political discussions, contributing to the broader fields of digital humanities and political studies. The findings underscore the importance of analyzing both combined and individual community sentiments to capture the complex nature of political discourse on Reddit.
